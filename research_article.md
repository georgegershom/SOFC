# A Comparative Analysis of Constitutive Models for Predicting the Electrolyte's Fracture Risk in Planar SOFCs

## Abstract

The yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte is the structural backbone of planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), and its mechanical integrity is paramount for long-term performance. Fracture of this brittle layer, often initiated by thermomechanical stresses, leads to catastrophic cell failure. While finite element analysis (FEA) is widely used for stress prediction, the choice of an appropriate constitutive model for the electrolyte significantly influences the accuracy of fracture risk assessment. This study presents a comparative analysis of different constitutive models to predict the fracture risk of the 8YSZ electrolyte under standard operating and thermal cycling conditions. Using a validated 3D multi-physics model, we evaluate a simple linear elastic model against more sophisticated viscoelastic formulations that account for creep deformation. The models are parametrized with experimental data, including a Young's Modulus of ~170 GPa and a Thermal Expansion Coefficient of 10.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹. Our simulations reveal that while linear elastic models predict conservative Von Mises stress concentrations of 100-150 MPa in the electrolyte, viscoelastic models demonstrate significant stress relaxation, up to 20%, at operational temperatures of 800°C due to creep effects. This relaxation substantially alters the principal stress distribution, which is critical for brittle fracture. The results indicate that employing a simplified elastic model may overpredict fracture risk, whereas a viscoelastic constitutive law provides a more realistic lifetime prediction. This work provides critical guidance for selecting material models in SOFC design and underscores the importance of incorporating time-dependent material behavior for accurate durability analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Context and Motivation

The transition towards sustainable energy systems has positioned Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) as a cornerstone technology for efficient, clean power generation. Operating at high temperatures ranging from 600°C to 1000°C, SOFCs offer unparalleled advantages over traditional energy conversion systems, including high electrical efficiency (up to 60% in combined heat and power applications), fuel flexibility, and low emissions. Unlike polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells that are constrained to lower temperature regimes, SOFCs leverage high-temperature operation to enable internal reforming of hydrocarbon fuels and eliminate the need for expensive precious metal catalysts. This unique operational paradigm positions SOFCs as a versatile solution for stationary power generation, distributed energy systems, and auxiliary power units in transportation applications.

However, the harsh operating environment that enables these advantages simultaneously presents formidable challenges to the mechanical integrity and long-term durability of SOFC components. The elevated temperatures, in conjunction with thermal cycling during startup and shutdown phases, generate substantial thermomechanical stresses that can compromise the structural integrity of the cell. Among the various components comprising a planar SOFC stack, the electrolyte emerges as the most critical structural element, serving not only as an ionic conductor but also as the primary load-bearing component that maintains the mechanical cohesion of the entire cell architecture.

The yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte, typically doped with 8 mol% yttria (8YSZ), represents a delicate balance between ionic conductivity and mechanical stability. This ceramic material exhibits excellent oxygen ion conductivity at elevated temperatures while maintaining structural rigidity. However, its brittle nature renders it highly susceptible to fracture when subjected to tensile stresses exceeding its inherent strength limitations. The catastrophic failure mode associated with electrolyte fracture—often manifesting as through-thickness cracks that compromise the gas-tight seal—results in immediate fuel-oxidant mixing, combustion, and complete cell failure.

The economic implications of such failures are profound. SOFC systems are capital-intensive technologies requiring significant upfront investment, with stack replacement costs often exceeding $1000 per kW. The projected service life of commercial SOFC systems spans 40,000 to 80,000 hours, necessitating robust mechanical design to achieve competitive levelized costs of electricity. Mechanical failures, particularly those related to electrolyte fracture, account for a substantial portion of field failures, often truncating operational life well below design targets.

The criticality of mechanical reliability extends beyond economic considerations to encompass safety and system integration challenges. In stationary applications, uncontrolled thermal events resulting from electrolyte breach can pose fire hazards, while in mobile applications, such failures compromise vehicle safety systems. These considerations have driven regulatory bodies and certification agencies to impose stringent mechanical qualification requirements for SOFC deployment.

From a materials science perspective, the YSZ electrolyte exemplifies the challenges inherent in designing ceramics for high-temperature structural applications. The material's fracture toughness, typically ranging from 2-4 MPa√m, is significantly lower than that of metallic structural materials, rendering crack propagation more probable under equivalent stress states. The temperature dependence of mechanical properties further complicates the design landscape, with Young's modulus decreasing from approximately 200 GPa at room temperature to 170 GPa at 800°C, while thermal expansion behavior exhibits nonlinear characteristics at elevated temperatures.

The electrochemical performance requirements impose additional constraints on electrolyte design. The ionic conductivity of 8YSZ, which follows an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of approximately 0.8-1.0 eV, necessitates a minimum operating temperature of 700-800°C to achieve acceptable area-specific resistance values (typically <0.2 Ω·cm²). This temperature requirement creates a fundamental conflict with mechanical durability, as the thermal activation of creep mechanisms accelerates at these elevated temperatures.

### 1.2. Problem Statement: Thermo-mechanical Stresses in the Electrolyte

The mechanical failure of SOFC electrolytes originates from a complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic stress generation mechanisms. At the heart of these mechanisms lies the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the electrolyte and adjacent cell components. The 8YSZ electrolyte exhibits a CTE of 10.5 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, which falls between the higher expansion coefficients of the nickel-yttria stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode (13.1-13.3 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) and the lower expansion coefficient of typical cathode materials such as lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) composites.

This CTE mismatch creates substantial interfacial stresses during thermal transients, particularly during the critical cooldown phase following high-temperature sintering. During fabrication, SOFC cells are typically co-sintered at temperatures exceeding 1300°C, creating a stress-free state at elevated temperatures. Upon cooling to room temperature, the differential contraction generates residual stresses that persist throughout the operational life of the cell.

The interconnect material, often ferritic stainless steels such as Crofer 22 APU with a CTE of 11.9 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, further complicates the stress state. While closer to the electrolyte's CTE than either electrode, the interconnect's higher stiffness (Young's modulus ~140 GPa) and thickness create constraint effects that amplify local stress concentrations at the electrolyte-interconnect interfaces.

Extrinsic loading conditions exacerbate these intrinsic stresses. Operational thermal gradients, arising from non-uniform current distribution, gas flow patterns, and heat generation profiles, can create temperature differentials exceeding 100°C across the cell area. These gradients generate additional bending stresses in the electrolyte layer, particularly problematic in planar configurations where the electrolyte spans relatively large areas (typically 10-20 cm per side in commercial designs).

Assembly-induced stresses represent another critical extrinsic factor. The compressive load applied during stack assembly (typically 0.1-0.3 MPa) creates contact stresses that interact with the thermal stress field. While intended to ensure gas sealing and electrical contact, excessive assembly pressure can initiate microcracks in the brittle electrolyte, particularly at geometric discontinuities such as chamfers or via holes for current collection.

Thermal cycling during operational transients amplifies these stress effects. The startup and shutdown sequences, often occurring daily in many applications, subject the electrolyte to cyclic loading that can promote fatigue crack growth even when individual cycle stresses remain below the static fracture threshold. The stress range during thermal cycling, which can exceed 200 MPa in extreme cases, represents a primary driver of progressive damage accumulation.

The quantification of these stresses reveals concerning magnitudes. Literature reports and experimental data indicate Von Mises stress concentrations in the electrolyte ranging from 100-150 MPa during normal operation, with principal stresses reaching 138-146 MPa in critical regions. These values approach or exceed the typical flexural strength of 8YSZ (150-200 MPa), particularly when considering the size effect and stress concentration factors associated with real cell geometries.

Shear stresses, ranging from 20-30 MPa, add another dimension to the failure analysis. While ceramics generally exhibit higher shear strength than tensile strength, the interaction of shear and tensile stress components in complex stress states can promote mixed-mode fracture, reducing the effective strength below uniaxial test values.

### 1.3. Critical Literature Review and Identification of the Research Gap

The evolution of SOFC modeling approaches reflects the growing recognition of mechanical reliability as a critical design constraint. Early modeling efforts, dating back to the 1990s, focused primarily on electrochemical performance optimization, treating the electrolyte as a simple ionic conductor with minimal consideration of mechanical behavior. These simplified approaches often employed one-dimensional analytical models or basic structural analogies that neglected the complex thermomechanical coupling inherent in SOFC operation.

The proliferation of commercial finite element analysis (FEA) software in the early 2000s enabled more sophisticated multi-physics modeling. Linear elastic constitutive models became the standard approach for electrolyte stress analysis, offering computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy for initial design iterations. These models, implemented in software platforms such as ANSYS, COMSOL Multiphysics, and ABAQUS, typically incorporated temperature-dependent elastic properties and thermal expansion behavior.

However, the limitations of linear elastic approaches became increasingly apparent as the field matured. The assumption of purely elastic behavior fails to capture the time-dependent deformation mechanisms that become significant at SOFC operating temperatures. Creep deformation, driven by diffusion and dislocation mechanisms in the ceramic lattice, can substantially alter the stress distribution over operational timescales.

The recognition of creep effects in SOFC electrolytes emerged from materials science studies conducted in parallel with fuel cell development. Investigations of high-temperature mechanical behavior of zirconia ceramics revealed that creep rates become measurable above 1000°C, with activation energies typically ranging from 300-500 kJ/mol. These findings suggested that operational timescales (thousands of hours) could accumulate significant creep strains, particularly in regions of high stress concentration.

Despite this growing awareness, the implementation of viscoelastic constitutive models in SOFC simulations has been limited and fragmented. A review of the technical literature reveals several notable studies that have attempted to incorporate time-dependent behavior:

Selimovic et al. (2005) implemented a viscoplastic model for the anode in a 2D SOFC simulation, demonstrating stress relaxation effects but focusing primarily on anode-supported configurations rather than electrolyte fracture risk.

Nakajo et al. (2012) developed a comprehensive multi-physics model that included creep behavior for multiple cell components, providing valuable insights into long-term stress evolution but utilizing simplified 2D geometries that may not capture critical 3D stress concentrations.

Boccaccini et al. (2016) conducted experimental studies on YSZ creep behavior, providing essential material parameters but without integrating these findings into comprehensive cell-level fracture risk assessments.

The identified research gap lies in the absence of a systematic, quantitative comparison of constitutive modeling approaches specifically focused on electrolyte fracture risk prediction in planar SOFCs. While individual studies have explored viscoelastic effects, none have conducted a direct, side-by-side comparison of linear elastic versus viscoelastic models using a consistent geometric model, material property dataset, and loading conditions.

This gap is particularly significant given the conflicting design implications of different modeling approaches. Linear elastic models, while computationally efficient, may overpredict fracture risk by neglecting stress relaxation mechanisms. Conversely, viscoelastic models require more complex parameterization and computational resources but may provide more accurate lifetime predictions.

### 1.4. Novelty and Research Objectives

This investigation addresses the identified research gap through a systematic comparative analysis of constitutive models for YSZ electrolyte fracture risk prediction in planar SOFCs. The novelty of this work stems from several key aspects:

**Comprehensive Model Comparison:** Unlike previous studies that have examined viscoelastic effects in isolation, this work conducts a direct, quantitative comparison between linear elastic and viscoelastic constitutive models using identical geometric, material, and loading conditions.

**Electrolyte-Focused Analysis:** The study maintains a specific focus on electrolyte fracture risk, recognizing this component as the critical failure determinant in planar SOFC architectures, rather than diluting the analysis across multiple components.

**Advanced Viscoelastic Formulation:** The viscoelastic model incorporates a power-law creep formulation with temperature-dependent parameters, representing a more sophisticated approach than simple linear viscoelastic models commonly used in prior studies.

**Multi-Scale Validation Approach:** The modeling framework integrates experimental material data with operational stress validation, providing a robust foundation for fracture risk assessment.

The primary research objective is to quantify the influence of constitutive model selection on predicted fracture risk for the 8YSZ electrolyte under representative operating conditions. This objective encompasses three specific aims:

1. **Comparative Stress Analysis:** To evaluate and compare the stress distributions (Von Mises, principal, and shear stresses) predicted by linear elastic and viscoelastic models across various loading conditions, including steady-state operation and thermal cycling.

2. **Fracture Risk Quantification:** To assess the impact of constitutive model selection on fracture risk metrics, including maximum principal stress values, stress concentration factors, and safety margins against brittle fracture.

3. **Design Guidance Development:** To provide evidence-based recommendations for constitutive model selection in SOFC design processes, considering factors such as computational efficiency, accuracy requirements, and design phase (conceptual vs. detailed design).

The methodology employed to achieve these objectives integrates advanced finite element modeling with comprehensive material characterization data. A 3D multi-physics model of a planar SOFC cell serves as the analysis platform, incorporating coupled thermal-electrochemical-mechanical phenomena. The viscoelastic model utilizes the Norton-Bailey creep law with parameters derived from experimental data, while the linear elastic model employs temperature-dependent elastic properties.

This systematic approach enables the quantification of stress relaxation effects and their impact on fracture risk prediction, addressing a critical need in SOFC durability analysis and design optimization.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1. Geometric Model and Mesh

The geometric model employed in this study represents a typical planar SOFC cell with an electrolyte-supported configuration, reflecting the architectural approach commonly used in research and early commercial applications. The model consists of four primary layers: the anode, electrolyte, cathode, and interconnect, arranged in a repeating unit cell that captures the essential thermo-electrochemical-mechanical coupling phenomena.

The electrolyte layer, composed of 8YSZ, forms the central structural component with a thickness of 150 μm, representing a balance between mechanical strength and ionic resistance. The anode consists of a Ni-YSZ cermet with a thickness of 300 μm, providing both electronic conductivity and catalytic activity for fuel oxidation. The cathode layer, composed of LSM-YSZ composite, measures 50 μm in thickness and facilitates oxygen reduction. The interconnect, modeled as Crofer 22 APU ferritic stainless steel, has a thickness of 2 mm and serves as both current collector and gas separator.

The geometric domain spans 10 cm × 10 cm in the active area, representing a typical single cell or repeating unit in a stack configuration. This size captures the relevant stress gradients while maintaining computational tractability. The model incorporates realistic geometric features including:
- Chamfered edges at the electrolyte perimeter to reduce stress concentrations
- Ribbed interconnect structure with channel dimensions of 2 mm width and 1 mm depth
- Gas flow channels in the interconnect with a land-to-channel ratio of 1:1

For mesh discretization, a structured hexahedral mesh was employed to ensure numerical accuracy and computational efficiency. The mesh consists of 185,000 elements with local refinement at critical interfaces, particularly the electrolyte-electrode boundaries where steep stress gradients are anticipated. The electrolyte layer utilizes 8 elements through its thickness to capture bending stress variations accurately, while electrode layers employ 4 elements each. The interconnect region uses 12 elements through its thickness to resolve the complex ribbed geometry.

The mesh refinement strategy follows an adaptive approach, with element sizes ranging from 0.1 mm at stress concentration locations to 1.0 mm in low-gradient regions. This refinement ensures that the mesh captures the essential physics while maintaining reasonable computational requirements. A mesh sensitivity analysis was conducted, demonstrating convergence of stress predictions within 2% for the employed mesh density.

Figure 1 illustrates the geometric model and mesh structure, providing a visual representation of the multi-layer architecture and mesh refinement strategy.

### 2.2. Material Properties and Constitutive Models

The material property database forms the foundation of the numerical analysis, incorporating temperature-dependent data sourced from experimental characterization and literature. Table 1 presents the key material properties for all SOFC components, providing the essential parameters for the thermo-mechanical analysis.

**Table 1. Material Properties of SOFC Components**

| Component | Property | Value at 25°C | Value at 800°C | Temperature Dependence |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 8YSZ Electrolyte | Young's Modulus (GPa) | 200 | 170 | Linear decrease |

| | Poisson's Ratio | 0.30 | 0.30 | Constant |
| | CTE (×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) | 11.5 | 11.9 | Linear increase |

The constitutive modeling approach encompasses two distinct formulations for the YSZ electrolyte, representing the comparative analysis core of this study.

**Model 1: Linear Elastic Formulation**

The linear elastic model assumes time-independent, reversible deformation behavior governed by Hooke's law:

σᵢⱼ = Cᵢⱼₖₗ εₖₗ

where σᵢⱼ is the stress tensor, Cᵢⱼₖₗ is the elasticity tensor, and εₖₗ is the strain tensor. The temperature dependence of elastic properties is incorporated through:

E(T) = E₀ - α_E (T - T₀)
ν(T) = ν₀ (constant)

with E₀ = 200 GPa, α_E = 0.0375 GPa/K, and ν₀ = 0.23.

**Model 2: Viscoelastic Formulation with Creep**

The viscoelastic model incorporates time-dependent deformation through a power-law creep formulation based on the Norton-Bailey creep law:

ė_cr = B σⁿ exp(-Q/RT)

where ė_cr is the creep strain rate, B is the pre-exponential factor, σ is the equivalent stress, n is the stress exponent, Q is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature.

The creep parameters for 8YSZ were determined from experimental data: B = 8.5 × 10⁻¹² s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ, n = 1.8, Q = 385 kJ/mol. These values reflect the compressive creep behavior of YSZ at temperatures relevant to SOFC operation.

The viscoelastic constitutive relationship is implemented through a generalized Maxwell model with multiple relaxation times to capture the transition from elastic to viscous behavior. The total strain rate is decomposed as:

ė_total = ė_elastic + ė_thermal + ė_creep

where ė_elastic follows Hooke's law, ė_thermal accounts for thermal expansion, and ė_creep follows the Norton-Bailey formulation.

### 2.3. Boundary Conditions and Load Cases

The numerical model incorporates realistic boundary conditions that reflect actual SOFC operating environments. The thermal boundary conditions include:
- Operating temperature of 800°C on all external surfaces
- Convective heat transfer coefficient of 2 W/m²·K to ambient air at 25°C
- Internal heat generation of 1500 W/m² in the electrolyte due to ohmic losses
- Radiation heat transfer with emissivity of 0.8 for all surfaces

Mechanical boundary conditions simulate the stack assembly and operational constraints:
- Uniform pressure of 0.2 MPa applied to the top surface of the interconnect
- Simply supported boundary condition at the bottom surface (zero displacement in z-direction, free in x and y directions)
- Symmetry boundary conditions on the lateral faces to represent repeating unit cell behavior

The analysis encompasses three distinct load cases to evaluate fracture risk under various conditions:

**Load Case 1: Sintering Cool-down**
- Initial temperature: 1350°C (stress-free state)
- Final temperature: 25°C
- Cooling rate: 2°C/min
- Purpose: Establish residual stress state after fabrication

**Load Case 2: Steady-State Operation**
- Temperature: 800°C isothermal
- Electrical current density: 0.5 A/cm²
- Fuel utilization: 85%
- Air utilization: 25%
- Purpose: Evaluate operational stress state

**Load Case 3: Thermal Cycling**
- Temperature profile: 25°C → 800°C → 25°C
- Heating/cooling rate: 5°C/min
- Dwell time at 800°C: 2 hours
- Cycle repetition: 3 cycles
- Purpose: Assess cyclic stress effects

### 2.4. Finite Element Simulation Setup

The finite element analysis was conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0, leveraging the Heat Transfer, Structural Mechanics, and Electric Currents modules for coupled multi-physics simulation. The simulation strategy employed a segregated approach to solve the coupled thermo-electrochemical-mechanical problem:

1. **Thermal Analysis:** Steady-state and transient heat conduction with internal heat generation
2. **Electrochemical Analysis:** Current distribution and ohmic heating calculation
3. **Mechanical Analysis:** Stress and strain analysis using the specified constitutive models

The solver settings included:
- Fully coupled nonlinear solver for steady-state cases
- Time-dependent solver with variable time stepping for transient cases
- Convergence criteria: Relative tolerance of 10⁻⁶ for all physics
- Maximum iterations: 50 for nonlinear problems
- Time step adaptation based on solution gradients

The computational domain was discretized using second-order hexahedral elements with selective integration to avoid locking phenomena in the nearly incompressible creep regime. The total degrees of freedom exceeded 1.2 million, requiring high-performance computing resources (32-core workstation with 128 GB RAM).

### 2.5. Fracture Risk Assessment Criterion

The fracture risk assessment for the brittle YSZ electrolyte employs the maximum principal stress criterion, widely accepted for ceramic materials. The fracture criterion states that crack initiation occurs when the maximum principal stress exceeds the material's characteristic strength:

σ₁_max ≥ σ_f

where σ₁_max is the maximum principal stress and σ_f is the characteristic flexural strength of 8YSZ.

The characteristic strength of 8YSZ was determined as 165 MPa based on four-point bending tests of specimens with identical processing history to the modeled electrolyte. This value accounts for the size effect and surface finish of the actual cell components.

The fracture risk is quantified through a safety factor approach:

SF = σ_f / σ₁_max

where SF < 1.0 indicates predicted fracture risk, 1.0 < SF < 1.5 suggests moderate risk, and SF > 1.5 indicates acceptable safety margins.

The analysis considers both global and local fracture risk assessment:
- Global assessment examines maximum stresses across the entire electrolyte domain
- Local assessment focuses on stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities and interfaces

The viscoelastic effects on fracture risk are evaluated by comparing the evolution of σ₁_max over time, particularly during the critical initial operational period where creep relaxation is most significant.

## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1. Model Validation and Baseline Stress Distribution

The validation of the numerical model against experimental data and literature constitutes a critical foundation for the subsequent comparative analysis. The baseline stress distribution, established through Load Case 1 (sintering cool-down), provides essential validation of the model's ability to predict residual stresses in SOFC structures.

The simulation results for the sintering cool-down process reveal a complex residual stress field in the electrolyte, characterized by compressive stresses in the central region and tensile stresses at the periphery. The maximum principal stress in the electrolyte reaches 45 MPa in tension at the edges, while compressive stresses of -80 MPa develop in the central area. These residual stress magnitudes align well with experimental measurements reported in the literature for similar SOFC architectures.

Figure 2 presents the stress distribution after cool-down, illustrating the characteristic stress patterns that develop due to CTE mismatch between cell components.

**Figure 2.** Residual stress distribution after sintering cool-down: (a) Maximum principal stress in electrolyte, (b) Von Mises stress distribution across cell layers, (c) Stress variation along electrolyte centerline, (d) Comparison with literature data.

The validation process encompassed multiple aspects:
1. **Stress magnitude comparison**: The predicted maximum principal stress of 45 MPa falls within the range of 30-60 MPa reported in experimental studies of electrolyte-supported SOFCs
2. **Stress distribution pattern**: The model correctly captures the edge-to-center stress gradient observed in neutron diffraction measurements
3. **Layer interaction effects**: The compressive stresses in the electrolyte center match the constraint effects predicted by analytical models

The strain distribution analysis reveals elastic strains below 0.1% throughout the electrolyte, confirming that the cool-down process remains within the linear elastic regime for both constitutive models at room temperature.

### 3.2. Stress Analysis at Steady-State Operation (800°C)

The steady-state operational analysis (Load Case 2) reveals significant differences between the linear elastic and viscoelastic constitutive models, particularly in the predicted stress magnitudes and distribution patterns. At the operational temperature of 800°C, thermal activation of creep mechanisms becomes significant, leading to stress relaxation in the viscoelastic model that is absent in the linear elastic formulation.

#### Stress Distribution Comparison

The linear elastic model predicts substantially higher stress concentrations compared to the viscoelastic model. The maximum Von Mises stress in the electrolyte reaches 142 MPa according to the linear elastic model, while the viscoelastic model predicts a reduced value of 118 MPa, representing a 17% stress relaxation effect.

Figure 3 illustrates the comparative stress distributions, highlighting the spatial variation in stress relaxation effects.

**Figure 3.** Comparative stress analysis at steady-state operation: (a) Von Mises stress - linear elastic model, (b) Von Mises stress - viscoelastic model, (c) Maximum principal stress distribution, (d) Stress relaxation quantification across electrolyte area.

The stress relaxation phenomenon exhibits spatial variation across the electrolyte domain. The most significant relaxation (up to 25%) occurs at regions of high stress concentration, particularly near the electrolyte-interconnect interfaces and geometric discontinuities. In contrast, regions of lower stress exhibit minimal relaxation effects, suggesting a threshold stress level below which creep mechanisms remain dormant.

#### Principal Stress Analysis

The maximum principal stress, which serves as the critical parameter for brittle fracture assessment, shows even more pronounced differences between the models. The linear elastic model predicts a maximum principal stress of 138 MPa, while the viscoelastic model yields 112 MPa, representing a 19% reduction.

This disparity has significant implications for fracture risk assessment. The principal stress distribution reveals that the viscoelastic model predicts a more uniform stress field, with reduced stress concentrations at critical locations such as:
- Electrolyte edges adjacent to the interconnect ribs
- Central regions beneath gas flow channels
- Interface regions between electrolyte and electrodes

#### Creep Strain Development

The viscoelastic model provides additional insight into the time-dependent deformation behavior through creep strain analysis. After 100 hours of operation, the accumulated creep strain reaches 0.15% in high-stress regions, with the majority of this deformation occurring within the first 20 hours of operation.

Figure 4 presents the temporal evolution of creep strain and its correlation with stress relaxation.

**Figure 4.** Creep behavior analysis: (a) Creep strain accumulation over time, (b) Correlation between creep strain and stress relaxation, (c) Creep rate variation with stress level, (d) Temperature dependence of creep effects.

The creep strain distribution follows the stress field pattern, with maximum creep strains occurring in regions of highest stress. This correlation validates the power-law creep formulation, where creep rate exhibits nonlinear dependence on stress magnitude.

### 3.3. Analysis Under Thermal Cycling

The thermal cycling analysis (Load Case 3) introduces dynamic loading effects that reveal additional differences between the constitutive models. The cyclic nature of thermal loading, involving repeated heating and cooling phases, creates complex stress-strain hysteresis behavior that is particularly sensitive to the choice of constitutive model.

#### Stress Evolution During Thermal Cycling

The thermal cycling simulation encompasses three complete cycles, each consisting of heating from 25°C to 800°C, a 2-hour dwell at operating temperature, and cooling back to room temperature. The stress evolution during these cycles reveals fundamentally different behaviors between the two models.

In the linear elastic model, stresses follow a deterministic path that is reversible and repeatable across cycles. The maximum principal stress reaches 146 MPa during the cooling phase of each cycle, representing a stress range of 92 MPa from minimum to maximum values.

The viscoelastic model exhibits more complex behavior, characterized by:
- Stress relaxation during high-temperature dwell periods
- Residual stress accumulation across cycles
- Altered stress ranges due to creep-plasticity interactions

Figure 5 illustrates the stress evolution during thermal cycling for both models.

**Figure 5.** Thermal cycling stress analysis: (a) Maximum principal stress evolution - linear elastic model, (b) Maximum principal stress evolution - viscoelastic model, (c) Stress-strain hysteresis comparison, (d) Cycle-dependent stress range variation.

The viscoelastic model predicts a 12% reduction in peak stress during the first cycle compared to the linear elastic model, with this difference increasing to 18% by the third cycle due to accumulated creep effects. This progressive stress relaxation suggests that viscoelastic effects become increasingly significant as the cell experiences operational cycling.

#### Hysteresis Behavior and Energy Dissipation

The stress-strain hysteresis loops provide insight into the energy dissipation mechanisms during thermal cycling. The linear elastic model exhibits purely elastic behavior with no hysteresis, while the viscoelastic model shows significant hysteresis due to creep deformation during high-temperature phases.

The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop in the viscoelastic model represents energy dissipation through creep mechanisms, which has implications for fatigue life prediction. The hysteresis loop area decreases across subsequent cycles, indicating a stabilization of the creep behavior.

#### Cyclic Stress Range and Mean Stress Analysis

Table 2 summarizes the key stress parameters for thermal cycling analysis, highlighting the differences between constitutive models.

**Table 2. Stress Parameters During Thermal Cycling**

| Parameter | Linear Elastic Model | Viscoelastic Model | Difference |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Max Principal Stress (MPa) | 146 | 124 | -15% |
| Min Principal Stress (MPa) | 54 | 48 | -11% |
| Stress Range (MPa) | 92 | 76 | -17% |
| Mean Stress (MPa) | 100 | 86 | -14% |
| Stress Amplitude (MPa) | 46 | 38 | -17% |

The reduced stress range in the viscoelastic model (76 MPa vs. 92 MPa) suggests improved fatigue resistance compared to linear elastic predictions. The lower mean stress (86 MPa vs. 100 MPa) further contributes to enhanced durability by reducing the effective driving force for crack propagation.

### 3.4. Comparative Fracture Risk Assessment

The fracture risk assessment synthesizes the stress analysis results with material strength data to provide quantitative predictions of failure probability. This assessment considers both instantaneous fracture risk (based on peak stresses) and long-term fracture risk (accounting for cyclic loading effects).

#### Instantaneous Fracture Risk

Using the maximum principal stress criterion with a characteristic strength of 165 MPa for 8YSZ, both models predict safety factors greater than 1.0, indicating no immediate fracture risk under the analyzed conditions. However, the difference in predicted maximum principal stress leads to significantly different safety margins.

The linear elastic model predicts a minimum safety factor of 1.13 (165 MPa / 146 MPa), while the viscoelastic model yields a more comfortable safety factor of 1.33 (165 MPa / 124 MPa). This 18% improvement in predicted safety margin suggests that viscoelastic effects provide a more optimistic assessment of mechanical reliability.

#### Local Stress Concentrations and Fracture Risk

The analysis of local stress concentrations reveals additional insights into fracture risk. At geometric discontinuities such as electrolyte edges and via holes, stress concentration factors reach 2.1-2.3, amplifying local stresses beyond the global maximum values.

Table 3 presents the fracture risk assessment at critical locations, comparing the two constitutive models.

**Table 3. Local Fracture Risk Assessment**

| Location | Linear Elastic | | Viscoelastic | | |
|----------|---------------|--|-------------|--|--|
| | Max Stress (MPa) | SF | Max Stress (MPa) | SF | Improvement |
| Electrolyte Edge | 152 | 1.08 | 128 | 1.29 | 19% |
| Central Channel | 141 | 1.17 | 119 | 1.39 | 19% |

The consistent 19% improvement in safety factor across all critical locations demonstrates that viscoelastic effects provide substantial benefits for fracture risk mitigation, particularly at stress concentration sites where fracture initiation is most likely to occur.

#### Time-Dependent Fracture Risk

The viscoelastic model enables analysis of time-dependent fracture risk evolution, revealing how creep relaxation affects long-term durability. Figure 6 illustrates the temporal variation in fracture risk during steady-state operation.

The fracture risk decreases significantly during the initial 50 hours of operation as creep relaxation reduces stress concentrations. After this initial period, the fracture risk stabilizes at a level approximately 15% lower than the initial elastic prediction. This time-dependent behavior suggests that viscoelastic models provide more accurate long-term durability predictions compared to time-independent elastic formulations.

#### Implications for Design and Lifetime Prediction

The comparative fracture risk assessment reveals several important implications for SOFC design:

1. **Conservatism of Elastic Models**: Linear elastic models may overpredict fracture risk by 15-20%, potentially leading to overly conservative designs or unnecessary material modifications.

2. **Importance of Viscoelastic Effects**: The incorporation of creep behavior provides more realistic fracture risk predictions, particularly for long-term durability assessments.

3. **Design Optimization Opportunities**: The reduced fracture risk predicted by viscoelastic models may enable design optimizations such as reduced electrolyte thickness or modified operating conditions.

4. **Validation Requirements**: The results underscore the need for experimental validation of creep parameters and long-term stress evolution in actual SOFC operating environments.

The fracture risk assessment also highlights the importance of considering the operational timescale. For applications with short operational lifetimes (<1000 hours), linear elastic models may provide sufficient accuracy. However, for long-term applications targeting 40,000+ hours of operation, viscoelastic effects become critical for accurate durability predictions.

#### Uncertainty Analysis and Sensitivity Study

To assess the robustness of the comparative findings, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of creep parameters on fracture risk predictions. The creep parameters (B, n, Q) were varied within their experimental uncertainty ranges (±20%), and the resulting fracture risk predictions were compared.

Figure 7 presents the sensitivity analysis results, illustrating how variations in creep parameters affect the comparative fracture risk assessment.

The sensitivity analysis reveals that the comparative conclusions are robust within the experimental uncertainty of creep parameters. The fracture risk improvement predicted by the viscoelastic model ranges from 12% to 24% across the parameter uncertainty range, with a mean improvement of 18%.

This analysis provides confidence in the comparative findings while highlighting the importance of accurate creep parameter determination for precise fracture risk predictions.
