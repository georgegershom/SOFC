\section{Background to the Study}\label{sec:background}
Open innovation (OI) has evolved from a conceptual provocation to a mainstream paradigm guiding how organizations source and exploit knowledge beyond firm boundaries. For small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially in emerging economies such as Tanzania, OI promises accelerated learning, access to complementary assets, and risk sharing. Yet, pervasive organizational barriers---from hierarchical inertia and risk aversion to resource scarcity and low absorptive capacity---continue to hinder OI adoption. Simultaneously, the diffusion of digital technologies is reshaping how firms search, select, and integrate external knowledge, positioning digital literacy as a potential moderator that attenuates the drag of internal barriers on OI engagement.

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:problem}
Despite the intensifying policy and scholarly focus on innovation-led growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzanian SMEs exhibit uneven uptake of OI practices. Evidence points to entrenched organizational constraints, fragile digital infrastructures, and skill gaps that depress collaborative innovation. However, the boundary conditions under which these barriers exert the strongest effects remain empirically underspecified. In particular, there is limited causal evidence on whether and how digital literacy at the owner/manager and workforce levels moderates the relationship between internal impediments and OI outcomes.

\section{Research Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
\subsection{General Objective}
To analyze organizational barriers to open innovation in Tanzanian SMEs and evaluate the moderating role of digital literacy on the relationship between barriers and OI engagement.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=O\arabic*., leftmargin=*]
  \item Identify and measure salient organizational barriers (e.g., structural rigidity, risk aversion, trust deficits, resource constraints, and cultural inertia).
  \item Operationalize digital literacy across technical, informational, communicative, and strategic dimensions within SME contexts.
  \item Estimate the direct effect of organizational barriers on OI engagement and the moderating effect of digital literacy.
  \item Contrast Tanzanian findings with global benchmarks and regional comparators using public datasets.
  \item Derive theoretically grounded and context-sensitive policy and managerial recommendations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Questions}\label{sec:questions}
\subsection{Main Research Question}
How do organizational barriers influence open innovation engagement in Tanzanian SMEs, and to what extent does digital literacy moderate this relationship?

\subsection{Specific Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}[label=RQ\arabic*., leftmargin=*]
  \item Which organizational barriers most strongly depress OI engagement in Tanzanian SMEs?
  \item How can digital literacy be measured reliably in SME settings, and how is it distributed across sectors?
  \item Does digital literacy mitigate the negative association between barriers and OI outcomes?
  \item How do Tanzanian dynamics (infrastructure, regulation, macro trends) shape OI relative to global benchmarks?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significance of the Study}\label{sec:significance}
\subsection{Theoretical Significance}
This work advances OI scholarship by modeling digital literacy as a socio-technical boundary-spanning moderator, extending resource-based and institutional perspectives to emerging economy contexts.

\subsection{Practical Significance}
For policymakers, the study informs targeted digital capability building under national ICT strategies. For SME leaders, it outlines pragmatic hybrid innovation pathways resilient to resource constraints.

\section{Scope and Delimitations}\label{sec:scope}
The study focuses on formal Tanzanian SMEs across manufacturing, retail, ICT, and agriculture. Data are cross-sectional with embedded qualitative follow-up, which limits causal inference; longitudinal extensions are recommended.

\section{Definition of Key Terms}\label{sec:definitions}
Open innovation, organizational barriers, digital literacy, SMEs, moderation, absorptive capacity.

\section{Thesis Structure}\label{sec:structure}
The thesis is organized into nine chapters spanning context, literature, theory, methods, quantitative and qualitative analyses, integrative discussion, and implications.
