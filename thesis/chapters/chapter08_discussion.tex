\chapter{Discussion and Integration of Findings}\label{ch:discussion}

\section{Synthesis}
Findings integrate to show that digital literacy operates as a boundary-spanning capability that attenuates the drag of organizational barriers on OI.

\section{Implications}
\subsection{Theoretical Implications}
We refine OI theory for emerging contexts by foregrounding socio-technical moderators.

\subsection{Policy Implications}
Targeted digital skills programs and enabling digital infrastructure can catalyze OI in SMEs.

\subsection{Managerial Implications}
Hybrid approaches that blend selective openness with capability-building are recommended.

\section{Limitations and Future Research}
Cross-sectional design and self-reported measures limit causal inference; future longitudinal and comparative studies are encouraged.
