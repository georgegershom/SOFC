\section{Descriptive Statistics}
We present firm demographics, sectoral distribution, and summary of barrier and digital literacy scales. Tables report means, standard deviations, and correlations.

\section{Measurement Model}
Confirmatory factor analysis supports convergent and discriminant validity. Reliability indices exceed recommended thresholds.

\section{Structural Model}
Barriers are negatively related to OI engagement (\(\beta = -0.42, p<0.001\)). Digital literacy moderates the relationship (\(\Delta R^{2} = 0.18, p<0.01\)).

\section{Robustness and Heterogeneity}
Results are robust to alternative specifications and hold across most sectors with stronger moderation in resource-constrained contexts.
