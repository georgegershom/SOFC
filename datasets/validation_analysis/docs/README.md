Validation & Analysis Dataset (Fabricated)

    Units:
    - length: mm
    - stress: MPa
    - strain: -
    - temperature: C
    - time: s
    - displacement: mm
    - angle: deg

    Files:
    - macro: material properties, cell geometry, sintering profile, surface residual stress (XRD-like)
    - meso: microstructure stats, RVE voxels, bulk residual stress (synchrotron-like)
    - micro: grain boundary properties, EBSD-like orientations
    - crack: crack events (critical T/load), SEM micro-cracks
    - simulation: full-field nodes and element summaries
    - collocation: selected points and their values

    Note: All data are synthetic but physically plausible and consistent across files.
