## Sintering Process → Microstructure Dataset (Synthetic)

This dataset fabricates a plausible mapping between sintering process parameters and resulting microstructure metrics. It is intended for method development, optimization benchmarking, and pipeline testing where real experiments are unavailable.

### Contents
- Data file: `/workspace/data/sintering_process_microstructure.csv`
- Generator: `/workspace/scripts/generate_sintering_dataset.py`
- Data dictionary: `/workspace/docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`

### Scope and assumptions
- Materials-agnostic ceramic baseline. Relationships are inspired by generic densification and grain growth trends.
- Higher peak temperature and longer hold → higher relative density, larger grains (bounded).
- Applied pressure (e.g., hot pressing) assists densification and modestly limits excessive grain growth.
- Atmosphere affects kinetics via small multipliers: `hydrogen > vacuum > argon ≥ nitrogen > air`.
- Faster ramp may slightly reduce densification uniformity; faster cool preserves smaller grains.
- Random noise emulates experimental variability; parameters are clipped to physically reasonable ranges.

### Column overview
See `/workspace/docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` for detailed definitions and units.

### Reproducibility
The generator is seedable: use `--seed` to reproduce identical rows.

### Regeneration
Example command:

```bash
python3 /workspace/scripts/generate_sintering_dataset.py \
  --n-samples 1000 \
  --seed 1729 \
  --out /workspace/data/sintering_process_microstructure.csv
```
