# Data-Driven Optimization of SOFC Manufacturing and Operation to Maximize Lifetime and Performance

## Abstract

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) represent a highly efficient energy conversion technology, yet their widespread commercialization is hindered by performance degradation and limited operational lifetime. This work presents a comprehensive, data-driven framework to optimize SOFC manufacturing and operational parameters to simultaneously maximize longevity and electrochemical performance. By integrating multivariate datasets encompassing material properties, sintering conditions, thermal profiles, and operational stresses, we identify and quantify the critical trade-offs governing system durability. Our analysis reveals that thermal stress, induced by coefficient of thermal expansion (TEC) mismatch between cell components, is the primary driver of mechanical failure modes, including crack initiation and interfacial delamination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that operational temperature and thermal cycling regimes non-linearly accelerate creep strain and damage accumulation in the nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode. The proposed optimization strategy pinpoints an optimal manufacturing window, recommending a sintering temperature of 1300–1350°C with a controlled cooling rate of 4–6°C/min to mitigate residual stresses. Concurrently, operation is advised at a moderated temperature of 750–800°C to balance electrochemical activity with degradation kinetics. This research establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging multi-physics and operational data to guide the design of next-generation, durable SOFC systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have emerged as one of the most promising energy conversion technologies for the 21st century, offering electrical efficiencies exceeding 60% and combined heat and power efficiencies approaching 90% [1-3]. These electrochemical devices directly convert chemical energy from hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels into electricity through a highly efficient, environmentally benign process. Unlike conventional combustion-based power generation systems, SOFCs operate without moving parts, produce minimal noise, and emit negligible pollutants when utilizing hydrogen as fuel [4].

The fundamental architecture of an SOFC consists of a dense ceramic electrolyte sandwiched between porous electrodes: a nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anode and a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) or lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode [5]. At elevated operating temperatures (typically 600-1000°C), oxygen ions migrate through the electrolyte from cathode to anode, where they react with fuel to produce electricity, water, and heat. This high-temperature operation enables internal fuel reforming and eliminates the need for precious metal catalysts, significantly reducing system costs [6].

Despite these compelling advantages, the commercial deployment of SOFC technology remains limited by critical reliability challenges. The primary impediment is the rapid degradation of cell performance over time, resulting in operational lifetimes that fall short of the 40,000-80,000 hours required for stationary power generation applications [7]. This degradation manifests through multiple interconnected mechanisms operating across different length scales and time scales, creating a complex multi-physics problem that has proven resistant to traditional optimization approaches.

### 1.2 State of the Art and Literature Review

Traditional approaches to SOFC optimization have predominantly relied on experimental trial-and-error methodologies combined with single-physics modeling frameworks. Early research efforts focused on isolated parameter studies, examining the effects of individual variables such as operating temperature, fuel composition, or electrode microstructure on cell performance [8]. While these studies provided valuable insights into specific degradation mechanisms, they failed to capture the complex interactions between multiple parameters that ultimately determine system lifetime.

The experimental characterization of SOFC degradation has revealed four primary failure modes that limit operational lifetime:

1. **Anode re-oxidation and nickel particle coarsening** lead to a progressive loss of electrochemically active surface area and increased polarization resistance [9]. The nickel phase in Ni-YSZ composites undergoes significant microstructural evolution at operating temperatures, with particle sizes increasing from 1-2 μm to 3-5 μm over 10,000 hours of operation.

2. **Cathode degradation through delamination and chromium poisoning** represents a major lifetime-limiting factor, particularly in systems utilizing metallic interconnects [10]. Volatile chromium species evaporated from stainless steel interconnects deposit at the cathode-electrolyte interface, forming insulating phases that block oxygen ion transport pathways.

3. **Electrolyte cracking due to thermal and mechanical stresses** poses a catastrophic failure risk that can result in fuel crossover and complete cell failure [11]. The brittleness of ceramic electrolyte materials, combined with stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities and material interfaces, makes them particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic loading conditions.

4. **Interconnect corrosion and oxidation** lead to increased electrical resistance and potential contamination of adjacent cell components [12]. The growth of oxide scales on metallic interconnects can increase area-specific resistance (ASR) from 10 mΩ·cm² to over 100 mΩ·cm² after 10,000 hours of operation.

### 1.3 Objective and Novelty

The primary objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a comprehensive data-driven methodology for co-optimizing SOFC manufacturing processes and operational strategies to maximize service life while maintaining high electrochemical performance. This work addresses the critical need for system-level optimization approaches that consider the complex interplay between multiple parameters and degradation mechanisms.

The novelty of this work lies in its unique integration of multi-fidelity datasets spanning material properties, manufacturing parameters, operational conditions, and finite element analysis results to perform a holistic sensitivity analysis and identify globally optimal parameter windows. Our data-driven framework leverages a dataset of over 10,000 virtual experiments generated through validated multi-physics simulations, enabling exploration of parameter combinations that would be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to investigate experimentally.

## 2. Methodology: Multi-Physics Modeling and Data Integration Framework

### 2.1 Component-Level Material Model Formulation

The foundation of our data-driven optimization framework rests upon accurate constitutive models for each SOFC component. Table 1 summarizes the key material properties used in our analysis.

![Table 1: Material Properties](table1_material_properties.png)
*Table 1: SOFC Component Material Properties*

For the elastic behavior of each component, we employed temperature-dependent Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio values. The Ni-YSZ anode exhibits significant property variation with porosity, with Young's modulus ranging from 29 GPa to 55 GPa at 800°C depending on the microstructural configuration. The temperature dependence is captured through:

$$E(T,\phi) = E_0(1-\phi)^n \cdot [1 - \alpha_E(T-T_0)]$$

where $E_0$ is the modulus of the dense material at reference temperature $T_0$, $\phi$ is the porosity, $n$ is the porosity exponent (typically 2-3), and $\alpha_E$ is the temperature coefficient.

The creep behavior of SOFC materials, particularly critical for the Ni-YSZ anode at operating temperatures, is modeled using Norton's power law formulation:

$$\dot{\varepsilon}_{cr} = B\sigma^n \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right)$$

where $\dot{\varepsilon}_{cr}$ is the creep strain rate, $B$ is the pre-exponential factor, $\sigma$ is the applied stress, $n$ is the stress exponent, $Q$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

### 2.2 Finite Element Model Setup and Validation

The finite element model was constructed using a representative SOFC geometry consisting of a planar cell configuration with dimensions of 100 mm × 100 mm active area. The mesh was refined at material interfaces and regions of expected stress concentration, with a total of approximately 250,000 hexahedral elements ensuring mesh-independent solutions.

Model validation was performed through systematic comparison with experimental data from multiple sources. Thermal cycling experiments conducted between 100°C and 600°C showed excellent agreement between predicted and measured strain values, with the model capturing both the magnitude and hysteresis behavior observed over five complete cycles.

### 2.3 Parameter Space Definition and Data Generation

The parameter space for our optimization study was carefully defined to encompass the practically relevant ranges for both manufacturing and operational variables. We identified eight key input parameters based on their demonstrated influence on SOFC performance and durability:

- **Manufacturing parameters:** sintering temperature (1200-1500°C), cooling rate (1-10°C/min), anode porosity (30-40%), cathode porosity (28-43%)
- **Operational parameters:** operating temperature (600-1000°C), current density (0-8000 A/m²), number of thermal cycles (1-5 cycles)
- **Design parameters:** TEC mismatch between adjacent layers (1.7-3.2 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹)

A total of 10,000 virtual experiments were conducted using Latin Hypercube Sampling to ensure uniform coverage of the parameter space while minimizing computational requirements.

## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1 Correlation Analysis: Identifying Dominant Degradation Drivers

The comprehensive correlation analysis of our 10,000-simulation dataset revealed critical insights into the hierarchical importance of various parameters governing SOFC degradation. Figure 1 shows the correlation matrix for key parameters.

![Figure 1: Correlation Matrix](figure1_correlation_matrix.png)
*Figure 1: Correlation Matrix of Key SOFC Parameters*

The most striking finding was the dominant role of TEC mismatch in driving mechanical failure modes. The correlation coefficient between TEC mismatch and peak stress hotspot values was 0.78 (p < 0.001), indicating a strong positive linear relationship. This correlation strengthened to 0.84 when considering only the subset of simulations with operating temperatures above 800°C.

### 3.2 The Impact of Manufacturing Parameters on Initial State and Residual Stress

Figure 2 illustrates the critical relationship between TEC mismatch and failure mechanisms, showing both stress generation and failure probability as functions of the mismatch magnitude.

![Figure 2: TEC Effects](figure2_tec_effects.png)
*Figure 2: Effect of TEC Mismatch on (a) Stress Generation and (b) Failure Probabilities*

The manufacturing process establishes the initial condition of the SOFC, creating a "stress history" that profoundly influences subsequent operational behavior. Figure 3 presents the optimization maps for manufacturing parameters.

![Figure 3: Manufacturing Optimization](figure3_manufacturing_optimization.png)
*Figure 3: Manufacturing Parameter Optimization showing (a) Crack Risk and (b) Residual Stress Maps*

The optimal sintering temperature range of 1300-1350°C produced well-developed sintering necks while avoiding excessive grain growth. Within this window, the electrolyte achieved >95% theoretical density while maintaining grain sizes below 5 μm. The optimal cooling rate of 4-6°C/min balanced stress generation and relaxation mechanisms, resulting in residual stress levels of 80-120 MPa, well below the fracture strength of ceramic components.

### 3.3 Operational Degradation: Linking Temperature and Cycling to Performance Loss

The transition from manufacturing to operation initiates a complex cascade of degradation mechanisms. Figure 4 demonstrates the critical trade-off between performance and lifetime at different operating temperatures.

![Figure 4: Operational Optimization](figure4_operational_optimization.png)
*Figure 4: Performance-Lifetime Trade-off vs Operating Temperature*

Temperature-driven degradation exhibited strong Arrhenius behavior across multiple mechanisms, with activation energies ranging from 120 kJ/mol for anode oxidation to 280 kJ/mol for chromium transport. The optimal operating temperature range of 750-800°C provides the best compromise between electrochemical performance (>0.7 W/cm²) and degradation rate (<0.5%/1000h).

Figure 5 shows the damage accumulation and voltage degradation over thermal cycles for different operating conditions.

![Figure 5: Damage Evolution](figure5_damage_evolution.png)
*Figure 5: (a) Damage Accumulation and (b) Voltage Degradation over Thermal Cycles*

### 3.4 Data-Driven Optimization and Pareto Analysis

The culmination of our analysis involved constructing Pareto fronts to identify optimal parameter windows that balance competing objectives. Figure 6 presents the Pareto front for performance versus lifetime optimization.

![Figure 6: Pareto Front](figure6_pareto_front.png)
*Figure 6: Pareto Front showing Performance vs Lifetime Trade-off*

The Pareto front analysis revealed a clear trade-off between maximizing initial performance and extending operational lifetime. The optimal compromise region, achieving >0.7 W/cm² initial performance with >40,000 hours lifetime, was identified at operating temperatures of 750-800°C.

Table 2 summarizes the optimization results and recommended parameter ranges.

## 4. Advanced Degradation Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies

### 4.1 Chemical Degradation Pathways and Interdiffusion Phenomena

Beyond thermomechanical degradation, chemical processes play equally critical roles in determining SOFC lifetime. Chromium poisoning of the LSM cathode represents one of the most severe chemical degradation mechanisms. The vaporization of chromium species follows:

$$\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_3(s) + \frac{3}{2}\text{O}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{CrO}_2(\text{OH})_2(g)$$

Our simulations predicted chromium accumulation rates of 0.5-2.0 μg/cm²·h at 800°C, leading to formation of insulating (Cr,Mn)₃O₄ spinel phases at the cathode-electrolyte interface.

### 4.2 Accelerated Testing Protocols and Lifetime Prediction Models

Developing reliable lifetime prediction models requires extensive validation against long-term operational data. We developed accelerated testing protocols employing multiple stressors simultaneously:

$$t_{accelerated} = t_{normal} \times AF_{total} = t_{normal} \times \prod_i AF_i$$

where $AF_i$ represents individual acceleration factors for temperature, cycling frequency, current density, and atmospheric contaminants. The combined acceleration protocol reduced testing time to 2,000-3,000 hours while maintaining degradation mechanism fidelity.

## 5. Conclusions and Future Perspectives

### 5.1 Summary of Key Findings
