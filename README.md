# SENCE Framework Vulnerability Analysis
## Niger Delta Petroleum Cities Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI)

This repository contains the implementation of an advanced vulnerability assessment framework for petroleum cities in Nigeria's Niger Delta region, based on the Socio-Economic Natural Compound Ecosystem (SENCE) framework.

## 📊 Overview

The analysis presents a comprehensive radar chart visualization comparing the vulnerability profiles of three petroleum cities:
- **Port Harcourt** (Rivers State) - CVI: 0.52
- **Warri** (Delta State) - CVI: 0.61
- **Bonny** (Rivers State) - CVI: 0.59

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Advanced Radar Chart Visualization**
- Multi-domain vulnerability assessment across 6 key subsystems
- Normalized contributions (0-1 scale) for comparative analysis
- Color-coded vulnerability zones (Low/Moderate/High/Critical)
- Smooth interpolated curves for enhanced visual clarity
- Statistical validation plots including PCA variance and correlation matrices

### 2. **SENCE Framework Domains**

#### Environmental Domain
- Oil Spill Impact (OSI) Index
- Gas Flaring Radiance (nW/cm²/sr)
- Vegetation Health (NDVI)
- Water Quality (NDWI)
- Mangrove Degradation
- Temperature Anomalies

#### Economic Domain
- Unemployment Rate
- Livelihood Dependence (HHI)
- Income Diversity
- Infrastructure Access
- Poverty Levels
- Market Resilience

#### Social Domain
- Healthcare Access
- Education Level
- Crime Rate
- Community Cohesion
- Housing Quality
- Safety Perception

#### Governance Domain
- Institutional Trust
- Policy Effectiveness
- Corruption Index
- Regulatory Compliance

## 🔍 Key Findings

### City Vulnerability Profiles

#### Warri - "Compound Vortex"
- Highest overall CVI (0.61)
- Balanced but intense vulnerabilities across all domains
- Critical environmental and economic stress
- Requires holistic intervention approach

#### Bonny - "Environmental Crisis Center"
- CVI: 0.59
- Extreme environmental vulnerability (0.89)
- Point-source pollution from LNG terminal
- High economic dependence on export enclave

#### Port Harcourt - "Urban Disparity Hub"
- Lowest CVI (0.52)
- More balanced vulnerability profile
- Urban socio-economic disparities
- Diffuse environmental challenges

## 📊 Statistical Validation

- **PCA Variance Explained**: 
  - Environmental: 71.2%
  - Socio-Economic: 68.4%
  - Integrated: 65.8%
  
- **Model Performance**:
  - R-squared: 0.947
  - RMSE: 0.031
  - MAE: 0.023

## 📚 Theoretical Background

The SENCE framework recognizes vulnerability as a **multiplicative and systemic** phenomenon rather than additive. Key principles:

1. **Compound Effects**: Vulnerabilities interact and amplify across domains
2. **Feedback Loops**: Environmental degradation → Economic decline → Social disruption → Institutional weakness
3. **Place-Based Analysis**: Each city has a unique "vulnerability signature"
4. **Holistic Assessment**: Integration of biophysical, socio-economic, and governance factors
