# SENCE Framework: Advanced Vulnerability Assessment Visualization

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of the SENCE (Socio-Economic Natural Compound Ecosystem) framework for vulnerability assessment of petroleum cities in Nigeria's Niger Delta region.

## Overview

The SENCE framework provides a sophisticated approach to assessing compound vulnerability by analyzing the interconnected relationships between social, economic, and environmental domains. This implementation includes advanced statistical analysis, model validation, and professional visualizations.

- Statistical overlays and confidence intervals
- City-specific vulnerability profiles for Port Harcourt, Warri, and Bonny

### 2. Comprehensive Statistical Analysis
- **File**: `sence_advanced_analysis.py`
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Correlation analysis between domains
- Model validation with cross-validation
- Sensitivity analysis
- Statistical significance testing

### 3. Framework Documentation
- **File**: `sence_framework_mermaid.md`
- Mermaid diagrams showing SENCE framework structure
- Vulnerability assessment workflow
- City-specific vulnerability profiles

   - Urban economic disparities (0.52)
   - Better infrastructure access (0.38)

2. **Warri (CVI: 0.61)**
   - Highest overall vulnerability
   - Severe industrial pollution (0.68)
   - Economic deprivation (0.71)
   - Inter-ethnic conflicts (0.65)

3. **Bonny (CVI: 0.59)**
   - Extreme environmental degradation (0.89)
   - High economic mono-dependence (0.76)
   - Point-source pollution from LNG terminal
   - Moderate social issues (0.54)

### Statistical Analysis Results

- **PCA Analysis**: First 3 components explain 73% of variance
- **Model Performance**: RÂ² = 0.775, RMSE = 0.018, MAPE = 2.9%
- **Statistical Significance**: Significant differences between cities (p < 0.001)
- **Domain Correlations**: Strong correlations between Environmental-Economic (0.956) and Social-Governance (1.000)
