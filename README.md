# Petroleum Cities Systems Map - Advanced Analysis Framework

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive systems dynamics model for analyzing compound vulnerabilities in petroleum cities, specifically focusing on Nigeria's oil-dependent urban areas (Port Harcourt, Warri, and Bonny). The framework visualizes and analyzes three dominant reinforcing feedback loops that create systemic risk in these cities.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ Three Dominant Reinforcing Feedback Loops

1. **R1: Livelihood-Environment Degradation Loop**
   - Environmental shocks â†’ Ecosystem damage â†’ Livelihood loss â†’ Socio-economic deprivation â†’ Artisanal refining â†’ Environmental degradation
   - Correlation strength: r = 0.78

2. **R2: Governance Failure Loop**
   - Compound vulnerabilities â†’ Institutional failures â†’ Erosion of trust â†’ Informal systems â†’ Weakened governance â†’ Inadequate response
   - Correlation strength: r = 0.65

3. **R3: Economic Diversification Failure Loop**
   - Oil sector dominance â†’ Crowding out alternatives â†’ Mono-economy â†’ Economic fragility â†’ Vulnerability to shocks â†’ Reinforced oil dependence
   - Correlation strength: r = 0.72 (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)

## Key Findings

### System Vulnerability Metrics
- **Current Composite Vulnerability Index**: 0.698 (high vulnerability)
- **System Stability**: Low standard deviation (0.002) indicates consistent vulnerability patterns
- **Network Density**: 0.059 (moderate interconnectedness)

### Policy Implications
1. **Economic Focus** shows highest improvement potential
2. **Multi-sectoral interventions** are essential to break reinforcing cycles
3. **Environmental protection** must be integrated with economic diversification
4. **Governance strengthening** is critical for effective policy implementation

### Intervention Optimization
Optimal intervention strategy targets all three loops simultaneously:
- Environmental quality: +0.300
- Governance effectiveness: +0.300  
- Economic diversification: +0.300
- **Vulnerability reduction**: 0.698 â†’ 0.532 (24% improvement)

## Methodology

### Systems Dynamics Modeling
- Based on research framework identifying multiplicative vulnerability processes
- Incorporates quantitative data (Composite Vulnerability Index, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
- Integrates qualitative insights from field surveys and focus groups

### Validation
