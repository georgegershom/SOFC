# Petroleum Cities Vulnerability System Model

## Advanced Systems Dynamics Implementation of Reinforcing Feedback Loops

This repository contains a sophisticated Python implementation of the **Systems Map of Dominant Reinforcing Feedback Loops in Petroleum Cities**, based on the SENCE (Systemic, Environmental, Contextual Embeddedness) framework for analyzing compound vulnerabilities in Nigeria's petroleum cities (Port Harcourt, Warri, and Bonny).

## üéØ Overview

The model demonstrates how environmental, socio-economic, and governance factors interact dynamically to amplify compound risks through three primary reinforcing feedback loops:

1. **Loop R1: Livelihood-Environment Degradation** - Environmental shocks cascade through ecosystem damage to livelihood destruction
2. **Loop R2: Governance Failure** - Institutional failures erode public trust and weaken governance capacity
3. **Loop R3: Economic Diversification Failure** - Oil sector dominance creates mono-economic vulnerability

## üöÄ Features

### Core System Model (`petroleum_cities_system_model.py`)
- **23 interconnected nodes** representing key system components
- **34 directional edges** with weighted relationships
- **8 identified feedback cycles** creating multiplicative vulnerability
- **Dynamic simulation** using differential equations
- **Real-time vulnerability tracking** across multiple dimensions

### Advanced Analysis (`advanced_analysis.py`)
- **Monte Carlo simulations** (100+ iterations) for uncertainty quantification
- **Sensitivity analysis** on critical parameters
- **Policy intervention scenarios** with comparative impact assessment
- **3D phase space visualization** of system evolution
- **Resilience pathway analysis** with strategic options

### Visualization Capabilities
- **Interactive network maps** showing all feedback loops and connections
- **Multi-panel dashboards** with 9+ analytical views
- **Time-series evolution** of vulnerability indices
- **Heat maps** of system states over time
- **Radar charts** for resilience profiling

## üìä Key Metrics & Findings

Based on the research data:
- **Oil spill correlation with poverty**: r = 0.78
- **Economic concentration (HHI)**: 0.72 (high mono-dependency)
- **Governance trust level**: 0.28 (critically low)
- **System-wide vulnerability**: 93.9% mean CVI

## üìà Model Architecture

### System Nodes (23 total)
```
Environmental: Oil Spills, Ecosystem Damage, Toxic Waste, Climate Vulnerability
Economic: Oil Dominance, Mono-Economy, Shock Vulnerability, Crowding Out
Social: Social Unrest, Migration Pressure, Trust Erosion, Informal Systems
Governance: Institutional Failure, Service Failure, Governance Weakness
Adaptive: Artisanal Refining, Rentier Mentality
```

### Edge Types & Dynamics
- **Direct**: Immediate causal relationships (weight: 0.7-0.9)
- **Reinforcing**: Positive feedback amplification (√ó1.5 multiplier)
- **Cascade**: Sequential failure propagation (√ó1.2 multiplier)
- **Adaptive**: Coping mechanism emergence
- **Systemic**: Cross-domain interactions

### Mathematical Framework

The system dynamics are governed by coupled differential equations:

```
dy_i/dt = -Œª_i(1 - œÅ_i)y_i + Œ£_j w_ij * f(type_ij) * y_j + S_i(t)
```

Where:
- `y_i`: State of node i
- `Œª_i`: Decay rate
- `œÅ_i`: Resilience capacity
- `w_ij`: Edge weight from j to i
- `f(type_ij)`: Amplification factor by edge type
- `S_i(t)`: External shock function

## üé® Visualization Examples

### Network Map Features
- **Node size**: Proportional to vulnerability score
- **Node color**: Heat map from green (low risk) to red (high risk)
- **Edge width**: Represents relationship strength
- **Edge style**: Different patterns for relationship types
- **Annotations**: Highlight three primary loops (R1, R2, R3)

### Dashboard Components
1. **CVI Evolution**: Tracks composite vulnerability over time
2. **Loop Intensity**: Monitors feedback loop strength
3. **Phase Portrait**: Shows system trajectory in state space
4. **Environmental Cascade**: Pollution ‚Üí ecosystem ‚Üí livelihood chain
5. **Trust Erosion**: Governance legitimacy decline
6. **Economic Risk**: Mono-economy vulnerability
7. **Intervention Scenarios**: Policy impact comparison
8. **Vulnerability Heatmap**: All nodes over time

## üìã Key Insights

### Critical Findings
1. **Multiplicative Vulnerability**: Risks amplify exponentially through feedback loops
2. **Lock-in Effects**: Path dependencies resist conventional interventions
3. **Cascade Potential**: Localized shocks trigger system-wide failures
4. **Governance Criticality**: Trust erosion mediates all vulnerability domains
5. **Adaptation Paradox**: Coping strategies amplify long-term risks

### Intervention Recommendations

**Immediate (0-6 months)**:
- Emergency ecosystem restoration
- Trust-building mechanisms
- Economic shock absorbers

**Medium-term (6-24 months)**:
- Economic diversification incentives
- Governance capacity building
- Alternative livelihood creation

**Long-term (2-10 years)**:
- Systemic oil dependency reduction
- Polycentric governance structures
- Anticipatory risk frameworks
