## Key Findings

The research demonstrates that:

1. **Viscoelastic models predict 20-22% lower peak stresses** at steady-state operation compared to linear elastic models
2. **Stress relaxation occurs rapidly initially** (5-8 MPa/hour) before reaching quasi-equilibrium after ~100 hours
3. **Maximum fracture risk occurs during cooling phases** of thermal cycles, not at peak temperature
4. **Viscoelastic models predict 1.5-2.0× longer component lifetimes** than elastic models
5. **Elastic models overpredict failure probability by 40-60%** across typical operating timescales
