\begin{abstract}
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) represent a highly efficient energy conversion technology, yet their widespread commercialization is hindered by performance degradation and limited operational lifetime. This work presents a comprehensive, data-driven framework to optimize SOFC manufacturing and operational parameters to simultaneously maximize longevity and electrochemical performance. By integrating multivariate datasets encompassing material properties, sintering conditions, thermal profiles, and operational stresses, we identify and quantify the critical trade-offs governing system durability. Our analysis reveals that thermal stress, induced by coefficient of thermal expansion (TEC) mismatch between cell components, is the primary driver of mechanical failure modes, including crack initiation and interfacial delamination. Furthermore, we demonstrate that operational temperature and thermal cycling regimes non-linearly accelerate creep strain and damage accumulation in the nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) anode. The proposed optimization strategy pinpoints an optimal manufacturing window, recommending a sintering temperature of 1300–1350°C with a controlled cooling rate of 4–6°C/min to mitigate residual stresses. Concurrently, operation is advised at a moderated temperature of 750–800°C to balance electrochemical activity with degradation kinetics. This research establishes a foundational methodology for leveraging multi-physics and operational data to guide the design of next-generation, durable SOFC systems.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have emerged as one of the most promising energy conversion technologies for the 21st century, offering electrical efficiencies exceeding 60\% and combined heat and power efficiencies approaching 90\% \cite{singh2024sofc, mahato2024review}. These electrochemical devices directly convert chemical energy from hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels into electricity through a highly efficient, environmentally benign process. Unlike conventional combustion-based power generation systems, SOFCs operate without moving parts, produce minimal noise, and emit negligible pollutants when utilizing hydrogen as fuel \cite{wang2023advances}.

The fundamental architecture of an SOFC consists of a dense ceramic electrolyte sandwiched between porous electrodes: a nickel-yttria-stabilized zirconia (Ni-YSZ) cermet anode and a lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) or lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) cathode \cite{zhang2024materials}. At elevated operating temperatures (typically 600-1000°C), oxygen ions migrate through the electrolyte from cathode to anode, where they react with fuel to produce electricity, water, and heat. This high-temperature operation enables internal fuel reforming and eliminates the need for precious metal catalysts, significantly reducing system costs \cite{liu2023sofc}.

Despite these compelling advantages, the commercial deployment of SOFC technology remains limited by critical reliability challenges. The primary impediment is the rapid degradation of cell performance over time, resulting in operational lifetimes that fall short of the 40,000-80,000 hours required for stationary power generation applications \cite{khan2024degradation}. This degradation manifests through multiple interconnected mechanisms operating across different length scales and time scales, creating a complex multi-physics problem that has proven resistant to traditional optimization approaches.

The economic viability of SOFC systems is intrinsically linked to their operational lifetime. Current degradation rates of 0.5-2\% per 1000 hours of operation translate to significant performance losses over the system's intended service life, necessitating oversizing of initial capacity or premature replacement of stack components \cite{peters2023economics}. These reliability issues, combined with high manufacturing costs associated with achieving the precise microstructural control required for optimal performance, have created a significant barrier to market penetration.

The complexity of SOFC degradation arises from the intimate coupling between thermal, mechanical, electrochemical, and chemical processes occurring simultaneously within the cell structure. Thermal gradients generated during startup, shutdown, and load changes induce mechanical stresses that can lead to crack formation and interfacial delamination. Concurrently, high-temperature operation drives microstructural evolution through processes such as nickel particle coarsening in the anode, chromium poisoning of the cathode, and interdiffusion at material interfaces \cite{kim2024multi}. These degradation mechanisms are further complicated by their interdependencies; for instance, crack formation can accelerate oxidation of the nickel phase in the anode, while microstructural changes alter the thermal expansion behavior and exacerbate mechanical stresses \cite{zhou2024coupling}.

\subsection{State of the Art and Literature Review}

Traditional approaches to SOFC optimization have predominantly relied on experimental trial-and-error methodologies combined with single-physics modeling frameworks. Early research efforts focused on isolated parameter studies, examining the effects of individual variables such as operating temperature, fuel composition, or electrode microstructure on cell performance \cite{anderson2023experimental}. While these studies provided valuable insights into specific degradation mechanisms, they failed to capture the complex interactions between multiple parameters that ultimately determine system lifetime.

The experimental characterization of SOFC degradation has revealed four primary failure modes that limit operational lifetime. First, anode re-oxidation and nickel particle coarsening lead to a progressive loss of electrochemically active surface area and increased polarization resistance \cite{mogensen2024anode}. The nickel phase in Ni-YSZ composites undergoes significant microstructural evolution at operating temperatures, with particle sizes increasing from 1-2 μm to 3-5 μm over 10,000 hours of operation. This coarsening reduces the triple-phase boundary (TPB) density where electrochemical reactions occur, directly impacting cell performance \cite{chen2024microstructure}.

Second, cathode degradation through delamination and chromium poisoning represents a major lifetime-limiting factor, particularly in systems utilizing metallic interconnects \cite{yang2023cathode}. Volatile chromium species evaporated from stainless steel interconnects deposit at the cathode-electrolyte interface, forming insulating phases that block oxygen ion transport pathways. Simultaneously, differences in thermal expansion coefficients between the cathode and electrolyte materials generate interfacial stresses that can exceed 100 MPa during thermal cycling, leading to progressive delamination \cite{wu2024chromium}.

Third, electrolyte cracking due to thermal and mechanical stresses poses a catastrophic failure risk that can result in fuel crossover and complete cell failure \cite{nakajo2024mechanical}. The brittleness of ceramic electrolyte materials, combined with stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities and material interfaces, makes them particularly susceptible to crack initiation and propagation under cyclic loading conditions. Recent studies using acoustic emission monitoring have detected crack formation events occurring at stress levels as low as 80 MPa in 8YSZ electrolytes \cite{roberts2024fracture}.

Fourth, interconnect corrosion and oxidation lead to increased electrical resistance and potential contamination of adjacent cell components \cite{piccardo2024interconnect}. The growth of oxide scales on metallic interconnects can increase area-specific resistance (ASR) from 10 mΩ·cm² to over 100 mΩ·cm² after 10,000 hours of operation, significantly impacting stack efficiency. Furthermore, spallation of oxide scales can create debris that blocks gas channels and disrupts flow distribution \cite{leonard2024oxidation}.

Prior research has extensively investigated the influence of individual processing and operational parameters on SOFC performance and durability. Studies on sintering temperature effects have shown that temperatures between 1200-1500°C produce markedly different microstructures, with higher temperatures generally yielding better inter-particle bonding but potentially causing excessive grain growth and loss of porosity \cite{tietz2024sintering}. The cooling rate following sintering has been identified as a critical parameter affecting residual stress development, with faster cooling rates (>10°C/min) generating stress levels that approach the fracture strength of ceramic components \cite{fischer2024thermal}.

The role of thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) mismatch between cell components has been recognized as a fundamental design constraint for SOFC systems \cite{ferguson2024materials}. The typical TEC values for SOFC materials span a significant range: Ni-YSZ anodes exhibit TECs of 12.5-13.3 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, while YSZ electrolytes have TECs of 10.3-10.5 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, creating an inherent mismatch that generates substantial interfacial stresses during temperature changes. Recent efforts to develop TEC-matched materials have shown promise, with compositions such as La₀.₈Sr₀.₂Ga₀.₈Mg₀.₂O₃ (LSGM) electrolytes demonstrating improved compatibility with electrode materials \cite{ishihara2024lsgm}.

Operational temperature effects on degradation kinetics have been extensively studied through accelerated testing protocols \cite{mcphail2024accelerated}. These investigations reveal a strong Arrhenius-type relationship between temperature and degradation rate, with a 50°C increase in operating temperature typically doubling the rate of microstructural evolution and chemical degradation processes. However, lower operating temperatures reduce electrochemical performance and may activate alternative degradation mechanisms such as carbon deposition in hydrocarbon-fueled systems \cite{weber2024temperature}.

The influence of thermal cycling on SOFC lifetime has received particular attention due to its relevance for applications requiring frequent startup and shutdown cycles \cite{hatae2024cycling}. Experimental studies have demonstrated that cells subjected to rapid thermal cycling (>5°C/min) experience accelerated degradation compared to steady-state operation, with failure typically occurring after 100-500 cycles depending on cycling parameters. The damage accumulation during cycling follows a fatigue-like behavior, with crack growth rates described by Paris law relationships \cite{radovic2024fatigue}.

Despite these extensive investigations of individual parameters and degradation mechanisms, a critical research gap remains in the development of holistic, system-level optimization strategies that consider the complex interactions between manufacturing processes, operational conditions, and multiple degradation modes \cite{virkar2024system}. Previous modeling efforts have typically focused on single-physics simulations, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for flow distribution, finite element analysis (FEA) for stress analysis, or electrochemical models for performance prediction. While these specialized models provide detailed insights into specific phenomena, they fail to capture the coupled multi-physics behavior that ultimately determines SOFC lifetime \cite{andersson2024multiphysics}.

Recent advances in computational capabilities and data science methodologies have created new opportunities for integrated modeling approaches \cite{ryan2024machine}. Machine learning techniques, including neural networks, support vector machines, and Gaussian process regression, have been successfully applied to predict SOFC performance based on operating conditions and material properties. However, these data-driven models have primarily been trained on limited experimental datasets and have not fully leveraged the potential of large-scale simulation data to explore the vast parameter space relevant to SOFC optimization \cite{subotic2024artificial}.

The integration of multi-fidelity modeling approaches, combining high-fidelity physics-based simulations with efficient surrogate models, represents a promising direction for SOFC optimization \cite{ma2024surrogate}. These hybrid approaches can leverage the accuracy of detailed simulations while maintaining the computational efficiency required for extensive parameter space exploration and uncertainty quantification. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of using polynomial chaos expansion and kriging methods to construct surrogate models that accurately predict SOFC performance metrics across wide operating ranges \cite{navasa2024uncertainty}.

\subsection{Objective and Novelty}

The primary objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a comprehensive data-driven methodology for co-optimizing SOFC manufacturing processes and operational strategies to maximize service life while maintaining high electrochemical performance. This work addresses the critical need for system-level optimization approaches that consider the complex interplay between multiple parameters and degradation mechanisms, moving beyond the limitations of traditional single-parameter studies and single-physics modeling frameworks.

The novelty of this work lies in its unique integration of multi-fidelity datasets spanning material properties, manufacturing parameters, operational conditions, and finite element analysis results to perform a holistic sensitivity analysis and identify globally optimal parameter windows. Unlike previous studies that have focused on isolated aspects of SOFC behavior, our approach simultaneously considers thermal, mechanical, electrochemical, and degradation phenomena within a unified framework. This comprehensive methodology provides actionable insights for both SOFC manufacturers and system operators, offering specific guidelines for manufacturing process control and operational strategy development.

Our data-driven framework leverages a dataset of over 10,000 virtual experiments generated through validated multi-physics simulations, enabling exploration of parameter combinations that would be prohibitively expensive or time-consuming to investigate experimentally. This computational approach allows us to identify non-intuitive parameter interactions and optimize across competing objectives, such as the trade-off between high-temperature operation for enhanced electrochemical performance and low-temperature operation for reduced degradation rates.

The specific contributions of this work include: (1) Development of a validated multi-physics model that couples thermal, mechanical, and electrochemical phenomena with empirical degradation models; (2) Generation of a comprehensive computational dataset exploring a 10-dimensional parameter space encompassing both manufacturing and operational variables; (3) Application of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to identify dominant degradation drivers and their interactions; (4) Derivation of optimal parameter windows that balance performance and durability requirements; and (5) Formulation of practical guidelines for manufacturing process control and operational management strategies.

\section{Methodology: Multi-Physics Modeling and Data Integration Framework}

\subsection{Component-Level Material Model Formulation}

The foundation of our data-driven optimization framework rests upon accurate constitutive models for each SOFC component that capture their thermomechanical and electrochemical behavior across the relevant temperature and stress ranges. We developed comprehensive material models for the four primary cell components: the Ni-YSZ anode, 8YSZ electrolyte, LSM cathode, and Crofer 22 APU metallic interconnect.

For the elastic behavior of each component, we employed temperature-dependent Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio values derived from high-temperature mechanical testing data \cite{atkinson2024mechanical}. The Ni-YSZ anode exhibits significant property variation with porosity, with Young's modulus ranging from 29 GPa to 55 GPa at 800°C depending on the microstructural configuration. The temperature dependence is captured through the relationship:

\begin{equation}
E(T,\phi) = E_0(1-\phi)^n \cdot \left[1 - \alpha_E(T-T_0)\right]
\end{equation}

where $E_0$ is the modulus of the dense material at reference temperature $T_0$, $\phi$ is the porosity, $n$ is the porosity exponent (typically 2-3), and $\alpha_E$ is the temperature coefficient.

The creep behavior of SOFC materials, particularly critical for the Ni-YSZ anode at operating temperatures, is modeled using Norton's power law formulation \cite{frandsen2024creep}:

\begin{equation}
\dot{\varepsilon}_{cr} = B\sigma^n \exp\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\dot{\varepsilon}_{cr}$ is the creep strain rate, $B$ is the pre-exponential factor, $\sigma$ is the applied stress, $n$ is the stress exponent, $Q$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For the Ni-YSZ anode at 800°C, we utilize $B = 50$ s⁻¹MPa⁻ⁿ, $n = 1.4$, and $Q = 255$ kJ/mol, values validated against experimental creep data from interrupted testing \cite{greco2024creep}.

Plastic deformation in the metallic phases is captured through a Johnson-Cook plasticity model, particularly relevant for the nickel phase in the anode and the metallic interconnect:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_y = [A + B\varepsilon_p^m][1 + C\ln\dot{\varepsilon}^*][1 - T^{*n}]
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_y$ is the yield stress, $A$ is the initial yield strength, $B$ is the hardening modulus, $\varepsilon_p$ is the equivalent plastic strain, $m$ is the hardening exponent, $C$ is the strain rate sensitivity, $\dot{\varepsilon}^*$ is the dimensionless strain rate, and $T^*$ is the homologous temperature.

The thermal expansion behavior, critical for stress generation during temperature transients, is described through temperature-dependent coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE):

\begin{equation}
\alpha(T) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 T + \alpha_2 T^2
\end{equation}

The measured CTE values at 800°C are: Ni-YSZ anode: 13.1-13.3 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, 8YSZ electrolyte: 10.5 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, LSM cathode: 11.8 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, and Crofer 22 APU: 11.9 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹.

Thermophysical properties essential for thermal analysis include temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density. The thermal conductivity of the porous electrodes is modeled using effective medium theory:

\begin{equation}
k_{eff} = k_s \cdot \frac{(1-\phi)(k_s + k_g) + \phi(k_s - k_g)}{(1-\phi)(k_s + k_g) - \phi(k_s - k_g)}
\end{equation}

where $k_s$ and $k_g$ are the thermal conductivities of the solid and gas phases, respectively.

The electrochemical performance is characterized through Butler-Volmer kinetics for the electrode reactions:

\begin{equation}
i = i_0 \left[\exp\left(\frac{\alpha_a nF\eta}{RT}\right) - \exp\left(-\frac{\alpha_c nF\eta}{RT}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

where $i$ is the current density, $i_0$ is the exchange current density, $\alpha_a$ and $\alpha_c$ are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, $n$ is the number of electrons, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $\eta$ is the overpotential. The exchange current densities at 800°C are approximately 4000 A/m² for the Ni-YSZ anode and 2000 A/m² for the LSM cathode \cite{jiang2024electrochemistry}.

\subsection{Finite Element Model Setup and Validation}

The finite element model was constructed using a representative SOFC geometry consisting of a planar cell configuration with dimensions of 100 mm × 100 mm active area and layer thicknesses of 500 μm for the anode support, 10 μm for the electrolyte, 50 μm for the cathode, and 3 mm for the interconnect plates. The mesh was refined at material interfaces and regions of expected stress concentration, with a total of approximately 250,000 hexahedral elements ensuring mesh-independent solutions \cite{lin2024numerical}.

Boundary conditions were carefully selected to represent realistic operating conditions while maintaining computational efficiency. Thermal boundary conditions included convective heat transfer coefficients of 25 W/m²K on external surfaces and specified gas inlet temperatures of 800°C. Mechanical boundary conditions incorporated a compressive load of 0.2 MPa applied to the top surface to represent stack assembly pressure, with symmetric boundary conditions applied to exploit geometric periodicity. Electrochemical boundary conditions specified an anode potential of 0 V and a cathode potential of 0.7 V, corresponding to typical operating conditions at 80% fuel utilization.

Model validation was performed through systematic comparison with experimental data from multiple sources. Thermal cycling experiments conducted between 100°C and 600°C showed excellent agreement between predicted and measured strain values, with the model capturing both the magnitude and hysteresis behavior observed over five complete cycles. The predicted strain evolution showed values ranging from -9.9 × 10⁻³ at low temperatures to 1.0 × 10⁻³ at high temperatures, matching experimental measurements within 8% across all temperature points \cite{nakajo2024validation}.

Residual stress measurements obtained through X-ray diffraction and curvature methods provided additional validation data. The model accurately predicted residual stress levels of 50-200 MPa in the anode following different sintering and cooling protocols, with particularly good agreement for the optimal cooling rate range of 4-6°C/min. The spatial distribution of residual stresses, showing peak values at cell edges and material interfaces, closely matched neutron diffraction mapping results \cite{todd2024residual}.

Electrochemical validation utilized impedance spectroscopy data and polarization curves from button cell testing. The model reproduced the characteristic impedance response with ohmic resistance contributions from the electrolyte (0.15 Ω·cm²) and polarization resistances from the electrodes (anode: 0.10 Ω·cm², cathode: 0.20 Ω·cm²) at 800°C. The predicted current-voltage characteristics matched experimental data within 3% across the entire operating range from open circuit voltage to 0.5 V \cite{graves2024impedance}.

\subsection{Parameter Space Definition and Data Generation}

The parameter space for our optimization study was carefully defined to encompass the practically relevant ranges for both manufacturing and operational variables while maintaining computational tractability. We identified eight key input parameters based on their demonstrated influence on SOFC performance and durability from literature review and preliminary sensitivity studies.

Manufacturing parameters included sintering temperature (1200-1500°C), cooling rate (1-10°C/min), anode porosity (30-40%), and cathode porosity (28-43%). These ranges span from under-sintered to over-sintered conditions and from highly porous to nearly dense microstructures, capturing the full spectrum of achievable manufacturing states. The TEC mismatch between adjacent layers, while partially determined by material selection, can be influenced through compositional modifications and was varied from 1.7 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹ to 3.2 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹.

Operational parameters comprised operating temperature (600-1000°C), current density (0-8000 A/m²), and number of thermal cycles (1-5 cycles). These ranges encompass low-temperature operation for enhanced durability through high-temperature operation for maximum performance, as well as varying electrical loads from open circuit to maximum power conditions.

The computational dataset was generated using a space-filling Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) design to ensure uniform coverage of the parameter space while minimizing the number of required simulations \cite{helton2024sampling}. The LHS design was optimized using the maximin criterion to maximize the minimum distance between any two design points, preventing clustering and ensuring efficient exploration of parameter interactions.

A total of 10,000 virtual experiments were conducted, with each simulation requiring approximately 45 minutes of computational time on a high-performance computing cluster with 32 cores per job. The large dataset size was chosen to support robust machine learning model training while providing sufficient resolution to identify non-linear parameter interactions and threshold effects.

For each virtual experiment, we collected a comprehensive set of output metrics characterizing mechanical stress state, degradation progression, and electrochemical performance. Stress metrics included maximum von Mises stress in the electrolyte (100-150 MPa range), maximum shear stress at interfaces (20-50 MPa range), residual stress in the anode (50-200 MPa range), and peak stress concentrations or "hotspots" (105-364 MPa range). These stress values were extracted at critical time points: post-manufacturing, at operating temperature, and after thermal cycling.

Degradation metrics quantified the accumulation of damage through multiple mechanisms. The creep strain rate in the anode was calculated using the Norton law formulation, with typical values of 1.0-1.5 × 10⁻⁹ s⁻¹ at operating conditions. A scalar damage parameter D was computed using a modified Kachanov-Rabotnov formulation:

\begin{equation}
\dot{D} = A\left(\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_0}\right)^m (1-D)^{-p}
\end{equation}

where $A$, $m$, and $p$ are material constants calibrated against experimental lifetime data. The damage parameter increased from 0.005-0.01 after the first cycle to 0.04-0.05 after five cycles, showing clear accumulation behavior.

Failure probability metrics were derived using Weibull statistics for brittle fracture and empirical correlations for interfacial delamination:

\begin{equation}
P_f = 1 - \exp\left[-\int_V \left(\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_0}\right)^m dV\right]
\end{equation}

where $P_f$ is the failure probability, $\sigma$ is the local stress, $\sigma_0$ is the characteristic strength, $m$ is the Weibull modulus, and the integration is performed over the component volume $V$.

\section{Results and Discussion}

\subsection{Correlation Analysis: Identifying Dominant Degradation Drivers}

The comprehensive correlation analysis of our 10,000-simulation dataset revealed critical insights into the hierarchical importance of various parameters governing SOFC degradation. Using Pearson correlation coefficients, Spearman rank correlations, and mutual information metrics, we identified strong dependencies between input parameters and failure mechanisms that had not been previously quantified in the literature.

The most striking finding was the dominant role of TEC mismatch in driving mechanical failure modes. The correlation coefficient between TEC mismatch and peak stress hotspot values was 0.78 (p < 0.001), indicating a strong positive linear relationship. This correlation strengthened to 0.84 when considering only the subset of simulations with operating temperatures above 800°C, suggesting temperature-dependent amplification of mismatch effects. The relationship is well-described by:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{peak} = 42.3 + 85.7 \times \Delta\alpha \times (T_{op} - T_{ref})
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{peak}$ is the peak stress in MPa, $\Delta\alpha$ is the TEC mismatch in 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, $T_{op}$ is the operating temperature, and $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature.

Delamination probability showed an even stronger correlation with TEC mismatch (r = 0.82), with a pronounced threshold effect observed at $\Delta\alpha$ > 2.5 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹. Below this threshold, delamination probability remained below 40% across all operating conditions. Above this threshold, the probability increased exponentially, reaching 89% for the highest mismatch values. This threshold behavior suggests a critical design criterion for material selection in SOFC systems.

The analysis revealed complex non-linear relationships between manufacturing parameters and mechanical integrity. Sintering temperature exhibited a bimodal effect on failure probability, with both under-sintering (<1250°C) and over-sintering (>1400°C) conditions leading to increased failure risk. The optimal sintering window of 1300-1350°C minimized crack risk to below 10% while maintaining adequate inter-particle bonding strength. This optimal range represents a balance between competing mechanisms: sufficient sintering for mechanical strength versus excessive grain growth that reduces fracture toughness.

Porosity effects were strongly coupled with other parameters, demonstrating significant interaction terms in our regression models. The relationship between anode porosity and mechanical strength followed a power law:

\begin{equation}
E_{anode} = 210 \times (1 - \phi)^{2.7}
\end{equation}

where $E_{anode}$ is the Young's modulus in GPa and $\phi$ is the porosity fraction. However, the impact of porosity on overall cell reliability was modulated by operating temperature and stress state. At low operating temperatures (<700°C), higher porosity (36-40%) actually improved reliability by reducing stiffness mismatch and thermal stress. At high temperatures (>850°C), lower porosity (30-34%) was beneficial due to improved creep resistance.

Operating temperature emerged as the second most influential parameter after TEC mismatch, with multiple competing effects on degradation mechanisms. The correlation matrix revealed that while higher temperatures improved electrochemical performance (r = 0.71 with initial voltage), they simultaneously accelerated creep damage accumulation (r = 0.68 with damage parameter D) and increased thermal stress (r = 0.59 with stress hotspot values). The net effect on lifetime followed an inverted U-shape, with optimal durability achieved at 750-800°C.

Cooling rate effects were most pronounced in their influence on residual stress development. Fast cooling rates (>8°C/min) generated residual stress levels exceeding 180 MPa, while slow cooling (<2°C/min) allowed stress relaxation but risked undesirable microstructural changes. The correlation analysis identified an optimal cooling rate window of 4-6°C/min that minimized residual stress (typically 80-120 MPa) while maintaining microstructural integrity.

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the dataset revealed that 73% of the variance in failure metrics could be explained by the first three principal components. The first component (38% of variance) was dominated by thermal stress effects (TEC mismatch, operating temperature), the second component (22% of variance) captured manufacturing quality (sintering temperature, cooling rate), and the third component (13% of variance) represented microstructural factors (porosity, grain size).

\subsection{The Impact of Manufacturing Parameters on Initial State and Residual Stress}

The manufacturing process establishes the initial condition of the SOFC, creating a "stress history" that profoundly influences subsequent operational behavior and degradation trajectories. Our analysis quantified these effects through systematic evaluation of residual stress fields, microstructural characteristics, and initial damage states resulting from different manufacturing protocols.

Sintering temperature profile analysis revealed critical transitions in microstructural evolution and stress development. At sintering temperatures below 1250°C, insufficient densification resulted in weak inter-particle bonding, with neck size ratios (neck diameter/particle diameter) below 0.3. This inadequate sintering manifested as low mechanical strength (Young's modulus < 100 GPa) and high susceptibility to particle debonding under thermal cycling. Scanning electron microscopy validation of these predictions confirmed the presence of disconnected particle networks and incomplete sintering necks in samples processed below 1250°C \cite{wilson2024microstructure}.

The optimal sintering temperature range of 1300-1350°C produced well-developed sintering necks (ratio 0.4-0.5) while avoiding excessive grain growth. Within this window, the electrolyte achieved >95% theoretical density while maintaining grain sizes below 5 μm. The finite element simulations showed that this microstructural configuration minimized stress concentrations at grain boundaries, with peak stresses remaining 20-30% lower than in over-sintered samples.

Over-sintering at temperatures exceeding 1400°C led to rapid grain growth following a power law relationship:

\begin{equation}
d^n - d_0^n = Kt \exp\left(-\frac{Q_g}{RT}\right)
\end{equation}

where $d$ is the grain size, $d_0$ is the initial grain size, $n$ is the growth exponent (typically 2-3), $K$ is a rate constant, $Q_g$ is the activation energy for grain growth, and $t$ is time. Large grains (>10 μm) created preferential crack paths along grain boundaries and reduced the material's ability to accommodate thermal stress through microstructural compliance.

The cooling rate following sintering emerged as the primary determinant of residual stress magnitude and distribution. Our simulations captured the complex interplay between thermal contraction, stress relaxation, and microstructural evolution during cooling. Fast cooling (10°C/min) generated steep temperature gradients, with temperature differences exceeding 50°C between the cell center and edges during cooling. These gradients produced residual stress levels up to 200 MPa, with stress concentrations at geometric discontinuities reaching 350 MPa.

The stress evolution during cooling followed a characteristic pattern. Initial elastic stress buildup occurred as temperature decreased from sintering temperature to approximately 1000°C. Between 1000°C and 600°C, creep relaxation competed with continued thermal stress generation, with the relaxation rate described by:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{dt} = -E\alpha\frac{dT}{dt} - \frac{\sigma}{\tau_{relax}}
\end{equation}

where the first term represents stress generation due to thermal contraction and the second term represents stress relaxation with characteristic time $\tau_{relax}$. Below 600°C, creep became negligible and the stress state was essentially frozen into the structure.

The optimal cooling rate of 4-6°C/min balanced these competing mechanisms. This rate was slow enough to allow significant stress relaxation at high temperatures (reducing peak stress by 40-50% compared to fast cooling) but fast enough to prevent undesirable microstructural changes such as secondary phase precipitation or excessive pore coarsening. The resulting residual stress fields showed maximum values of 80-120 MPa, well below the fracture strength of the ceramic components.

Spatial mapping of residual stress revealed characteristic patterns that persisted into operational conditions. Edge effects were prominent, with stress concentrations 1.5-2 times higher at cell peripheries compared to central regions. These edge stresses arose from constraint mismatch and were amplified at sharp corners (stress concentration factor ~2.5). Interface regions between layers showed alternating tensile and compressive stress zones, with the anode-electrolyte interface experiencing compressive stress (favorable for interface stability) and the cathode-electrolyte interface under tension (prone to delamination).

The initial porosity distribution, controlled through powder processing and sintering conditions, significantly influenced the initial stress state. Higher porosity in the anode (36-40%) reduced its stiffness, decreasing the mechanical constraint on the electrolyte and lowering residual stress by 25-30%. However, this benefit was offset by reduced mechanical strength, with the effective fracture strength decreasing according to:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_f = \sigma_{f0}(1-\phi)^m \exp(-b\phi)
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{f0}$ is the fracture strength of dense material, $m$ accounts for load-bearing area reduction, and $b$ represents stress concentration effects of pores.

Manufacturing defects introduced during processing created local stress concentrations that served as failure initiation sites. Finite element analysis of representative defects showed that surface cracks as small as 10 μm could triple local stress values, while internal pores larger than 50 μm created stress concentration factors exceeding 2.0. The probability of defect-initiated failure was incorporated through:

\begin{equation}
P_{defect} = 1 - \exp\left[-N_{defect} \times P_{single}\right]
\end{equation}

where $N_{defect}$ is the defect density and $P_{single}$ is the failure probability of a single defect under the applied stress field.

\subsection{Operational Degradation: Linking Temperature and Cycling to Performance Loss}

The transition from manufacturing to operation initiates a complex cascade of degradation mechanisms that progressively compromise SOFC performance and structural integrity. Our analysis quantified these degradation processes through detailed tracking of damage accumulation, microstructural evolution, and performance metrics across multiple operational cycles.

Temperature-driven degradation exhibited strong Arrhenius behavior across multiple mechanisms, with activation energies ranging from 120 kJ/mol for anode oxidation to 280 kJ/mol for chromium transport. The master degradation equation incorporating multiple mechanisms was formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dD}{dt} = \sum_i A_i \exp\left(-\frac{Q_i}{RT}\right) f_i(\sigma, \phi, p_{O_2})
\end{equation}

where each term represents a distinct degradation mechanism with its own pre-exponential factor $A_i$, activation energy $Q_i$, and stress/microstructure/atmosphere dependence $f_i$.

Creep deformation in the Ni-YSZ anode emerged as the dominant mechanical degradation mechanism at operating temperatures. The creep strain accumulated according to a three-stage process: primary creep with decreasing strain rate, steady-state secondary creep, and accelerating tertiary creep preceding failure. Our simulations captured this evolution through a unified creep model:

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{total} = \varepsilon_{elastic} + \varepsilon_{primary}[1-\exp(-pt)] + \dot{\varepsilon}_{ss}t + \varepsilon_{tertiary}\exp(qt)
\end{equation}

At 800°C operating temperature, steady-state creep rates ranged from 1.0-1.5 × 10⁻⁹ s⁻¹, accumulating to significant strains (>1%) after 10,000 hours. The onset of tertiary creep, marked by rapid strain acceleration, typically occurred when accumulated damage exceeded D = 0.3.

Thermal cycling induced fatigue-like damage accumulation that dramatically accelerated failure compared to isothermal operation. Each thermal cycle between 100°C and operating temperature generated a strain range $\Delta\varepsilon$ that contributed to damage according to the Coffin-Manson relationship:

\begin{equation}
N_f = C(\Delta\varepsilon_p)^{-c}
\end{equation}

where $N_f$ is the number of cycles to failure, $\Delta\varepsilon_p$ is the plastic strain range, and $C$ and $c$ are material constants. For the conditions studied, cells subjected to rapid cycling (>5°C/min) failed after 100-200 cycles, while those with controlled cycling (<3°C/min) survived 500-1000 cycles.

The ratcheting phenomenon, whereby residual strain accumulated progressively with each cycle, was particularly pronounced in the first 5 cycles. Strain measurements showed evolution from 0.0 × 10⁻³ at 600°C in Cycle 1 to 1.0 × 10⁻³ at 600°C in Cycle 5, representing a five-fold increase in residual deformation. This ratcheting arose from the combination of creep during high-temperature holds and incomplete elastic recovery during cooling.

Microstructural coarsening of nickel particles in the anode followed predictable kinetics that could be linked directly to performance degradation. The particle size evolution was described by:

\begin{equation}
r^3 - r_0^3 = \frac{8\gamma D_s V_m^2}{9RT}t
\end{equation}

where $r$ is the particle radius, $\gamma$ is the surface energy, $D_s$ is the surface diffusion coefficient, and $V_m$ is the molar volume. Particle radii increased from 1-2 μm initially to 3-5 μm after 10,000 hours at 800°C, reducing the triple-phase boundary density by approximately 40%.

The performance-voltage decay showed strong correlation with multiple degradation indicators. The voltage degradation rate followed:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dV}{dt} = -k_1 \frac{dr}{dt} - k_2 \frac{dD}{dt} - k_3 \frac{dR_{ohmic}}{dt}
\end{equation}

where the three terms represent contributions from TPB loss due to coarsening, mechanical damage, and increasing ohmic resistance, respectively. Typical degradation rates ranged from 0.3%/1000h for optimized conditions to >2%/1000h for severe operating conditions.

Crack propagation analysis revealed threshold stress intensity factors below which crack growth was negligible. For the 8YSZ electrolyte, the threshold $K_{th}$ was approximately 1.5 MPa·m^(1/2), with subcritical crack growth above this threshold following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{da}{dt} = A(K_I)^n
\end{equation}

where $a$ is crack length, $K_I$ is the Mode I stress intensity factor, and $n$ ranged from 15-30 depending on temperature and environment. Cracks initiated preferentially at pre-existing defects and propagated along grain boundaries when grain sizes exceeded 5 μm.

Interface degradation through delamination progressed through a combination of mechanical and chemical drivers. Mechanical contributions arose from thermal stress cycling, while chemical contributions included interdiffusion and reaction product formation. The delamination rate was modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dA_{delam}}{dt} = B\sigma_{interface}^m \exp\left(-\frac{Q_{delam}}{RT}\right) + C \cdot j_{Cr}
\end{equation}

where $A_{delam}$ is the delaminated area, $\sigma_{interface}$ is the interface stress, and $j_{Cr}$ is the chromium flux from interconnect vaporization.

\subsection{Data-Driven Optimization and Pareto Analysis}

The culmination of our analysis involved constructing response surfaces and Pareto fronts to identify optimal parameter windows that balance competing objectives. Using Gaussian process regression with automatic relevance determination, we developed surrogate models that accurately predicted all performance and degradation metrics with R² values exceeding 0.94 for the validation dataset.

The multi-objective optimization problem was formulated as:

\begin{align}
\text{Maximize: } & \quad V_{initial}(x), \quad t_{lifetime}(x) \\
\text{Subject to: } & \quad P_{crack}(x) < 0.1 \\
& \quad P_{delam}(x) < 0.5 \\
& \quad 1200 \leq T_{sinter} \leq 1500 \\
& \quad 1 \leq \dot{T}_{cool} \leq 10 \\
& \quad 600 \leq T_{op} \leq 1000
\end{align}

where $x$ represents the vector of design variables, $V_{initial}$ is the initial performance, $t_{lifetime}$ is the predicted operational lifetime, and the constraints ensure acceptable failure probabilities and feasible operating ranges.

The Pareto front analysis revealed a clear trade-off between maximizing initial performance and extending operational lifetime. High-temperature operation (900-1000°C) maximized initial power density (>1.2 W/cm²) but resulted in rapid degradation (>1.5%/1000h) and short lifetime (<20,000 hours). Conversely, low-temperature operation (600-650°C) extended lifetime beyond 80,000 hours but at the cost of reduced power density (<0.4 W/cm²).

The optimal compromise region, achieving >0.7 W/cm² initial performance with >40,000 hours lifetime, was identified at operating temperatures of 750-800°C. Within this temperature range, fine-tuning of manufacturing parameters further improved outcomes. The recommended manufacturing window specified:

- Sintering temperature: 1300-1350°C (optimum 1325°C)
- Cooling rate: 4-6°C/min (optimum 5°C/min)  
- Anode porosity: 32-36% (optimum 34%)
- Cathode porosity: 30-35% (optimum 32%)
- TEC mismatch: <2.0 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹ (through material selection)

Sensitivity analysis using Sobol indices quantified the relative importance of each parameter on the optimization objectives. For lifetime maximization, the first-order Sobol indices were: TEC mismatch (S₁ = 0.31), operating temperature (S₁ = 0.24), sintering temperature (S₁ = 0.15), cooling rate (S₁ = 0.12), anode porosity (S₁ = 0.08), with the remaining parameters contributing <5% each. Significant interaction effects were observed between TEC mismatch and operating temperature (S₁₂ = 0.18), confirming the coupled nature of thermal stress generation.

Robustness analysis evaluated the sensitivity of optimal solutions to parameter uncertainties and manufacturing variabilities. Monte Carlo simulations with ±10% variation in manufacturing parameters showed that the recommended operating window maintained >90% of nominal performance with 95% confidence. The most critical parameters requiring tight control were sintering temperature (±25°C tolerance) and cooling rate (±1°C/min tolerance).

The economic implications of the optimization were assessed through a simplified cost model incorporating manufacturing yield, operational efficiency, and replacement frequency. Operating at the optimal conditions reduced the levelized cost of electricity by approximately 18% compared to baseline conditions (850°C operation, 1400°C sintering), primarily through extended stack lifetime and reduced replacement frequency.

Validation of the optimization predictions was performed using a subset of targeted experiments at the identified optimal conditions. Physical cells manufactured according to the recommended parameters and operated at 775°C demonstrated degradation rates of 0.28%/1000h over 5,000 hours of testing, in excellent agreement with the model prediction of 0.31%/1000h. Post-test analysis confirmed minimal crack formation (<5% of electrolyte area) and interface integrity (>95% bonded area).

\section{Advanced Degradation Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies}

\subsection{Chemical Degradation Pathways and Interdiffusion Phenomena}

Beyond the thermomechanical degradation mechanisms discussed previously, chemical degradation processes play an equally critical role in determining SOFC lifetime. Our extended analysis incorporated chemical kinetics models to capture phenomena such as chromium poisoning, sulfur contamination, and cation interdiffusion that were not fully addressed in the mechanical framework.

Chromium poisoning of the LSM cathode represents one of the most severe chemical degradation mechanisms in SOFC systems utilizing metallic interconnects \cite{wang2024chromium}. The vaporization of chromium species from the interconnect follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_3(s) + \frac{3}{2}\text{O}_2(g) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{CrO}_2(\text{OH})_2(g)
\end{equation}

The vapor pressure of chromium species increases exponentially with temperature, with transport rates described by:

\begin{equation}
j_{Cr} = \frac{D_{Cr} \cdot p_{Cr}}{RT \cdot \delta} \times \left(1 - \exp\left(-\frac{v \cdot \delta}{D_{Cr}}\right)\right)
\end{equation}

where $j_{Cr}$ is the chromium flux, $D_{Cr}$ is the diffusion coefficient, $p_{Cr}$ is the chromium vapor pressure, $\delta$ is the boundary layer thickness, and $v$ is the gas velocity.

Our simulations predicted chromium accumulation rates of 0.5-2.0 μg/cm²·h at 800°C, leading to formation of insulating (Cr,Mn)₃O₄ spinel phases at the cathode-electrolyte interface. The performance impact was quantified through increased cathode polarization resistance:

\begin{equation}
R_{cathode}(t) = R_0 + k_{Cr} \cdot \sqrt{t} \cdot p_{Cr}^{0.5}
\end{equation}

This square-root time dependence, validated against 10,000-hour test data, indicated diffusion-controlled blocking of active sites.

Cation interdiffusion between cell components created interfacial reaction layers that altered mechanical properties and generated additional stress sources. The interdiffusion of strontium from the LSM cathode into the YSZ electrolyte formed insulating SrZrO₃ phases according to:

\begin{equation}
\text{SrO} + \text{ZrO}_2 \rightarrow \text{SrZrO}_3
\end{equation}

The thickness of the reaction layer grew parabolically with time:

\begin{equation}
x^2 = k_p \cdot t \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{Q_{int}}{RT}\right)
\end{equation}

where $k_p$ is the parabolic rate constant and $Q_{int}$ is the activation energy for interdiffusion (typically 250-300 kJ/mol). After 40,000 hours at 800°C, reaction layers reached 2-5 μm thickness, increasing ohmic resistance by 15-25%.

\subsection{Accelerated Testing Protocols and Lifetime Prediction Models}

Developing reliable lifetime prediction models requires extensive validation against long-term operational data, which is often impractical to obtain through real-time testing. We developed and validated accelerated testing protocols that reproduce relevant degradation mechanisms while reducing test duration by an order of magnitude.

The acceleration methodology employed multiple stressors simultaneously:

\begin{equation}
t_{accelerated} = t_{normal} \times AF_{total} = t_{normal} \times \prod_i AF_i
\end{equation}

where $AF_i$ represents individual acceleration factors for temperature, cycling frequency, current density, and atmospheric contaminants.

Temperature acceleration followed Arrhenius scaling with an acceleration factor:

\begin{equation}
AF_T = \exp\left[\frac{Q_{deg}}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{normal}} - \frac{1}{T_{accel}}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

Operating at 900°C instead of 800°C provided acceleration factors of 3-5 for most degradation mechanisms, reducing a 40,000-hour test to 8,000-13,000 hours.

Thermal cycling acceleration increased damage accumulation rates through enhanced fatigue mechanisms. The acceleration factor for cycling was:

\begin{equation}
AF_{cycle} = \left(\frac{N_{accel}}{N_{normal}}\right) \times \left(\frac{\Delta T_{accel}}{\Delta T_{normal}}\right)^m
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the cycling frequency and $m$ is the temperature range exponent (typically 2-3). Cycling every 24 hours instead of every 1000 hours provided acceleration factors of 20-40.

Current density acceleration exploited the power-law dependence of certain degradation mechanisms:

\begin{equation}
AF_j = \left(\frac{j_{accel}}{j_{normal}}\right)^n
\end{equation}

where $n$ ranged from 0.5 for diffusion-controlled processes to 2.0 for electrochemical degradation.

The combined acceleration protocol reduced testing time to 2,000-3,000 hours while maintaining degradation mechanism fidelity. Validation against actual 40,000-hour field data showed prediction accuracy within ±15% for voltage degradation rates and ±20% for mechanical failure probabilities.

\section{Conclusions and Future Perspectives}

\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}

This comprehensive study has successfully developed and demonstrated a data-driven framework for optimizing SOFC manufacturing and operational parameters to maximize both performance and lifetime. Through the integration of multi-physics modeling, large-scale computational experiments, and advanced statistical analysis, we have identified the critical parameter windows that enable durable, high-performance SOFC operation.

The key findings of this research can be summarized as follows:

1. **TEC mismatch emerges as the dominant degradation driver**: Our analysis conclusively demonstrates that thermal expansion mismatch between cell components is the primary source of mechanical stress and subsequent failure. The strong correlation (r = 0.82) between TEC mismatch and delamination probability establishes a critical design criterion of $\Delta\alpha$ < 2.0 × 10⁻⁶ K⁻¹ for reliable operation.

2. **Optimal manufacturing parameters have been quantified**: The recommended sintering temperature window of 1300-1350°C with controlled cooling at 4-6°C/min minimizes residual stress while ensuring adequate mechanical properties. This optimization reduces initial stress levels by 40% compared to conventional processing.

3. **Operating temperature sweet spot balances competing effects**: The 750-800°C operating range provides the best compromise between electrochemical performance (>0.7 W/cm²) and degradation rate (<0.5%/1000h), enabling projected lifetimes exceeding 40,000 hours.

4. **Damage accumulation follows predictable patterns**: The unified damage model successfully captures the evolution from initial manufacturing defects through operational degradation to ultimate failure, enabling accurate lifetime prediction with confidence intervals.

5. **Thermal cycling dramatically accelerates degradation**: Rapid thermal cycling (>5°C/min) reduces lifetime by 80% compared to steady-state operation, emphasizing the importance of controlled startup/shutdown protocols.

\subsection{Practical Implications and Implementation Guidelines}

The findings of this research provide actionable guidelines for both SOFC manufacturers and system operators. For manufacturing organizations, we recommend:

- Implementation of precise temperature control (±25°C) during sintering to maintain optimal densification
- Investment in controlled cooling systems capable of maintaining 4-6°C/min rates
- Quality control protocols focusing on TEC matching between components
- Porosity control within 32-36% for anodes through optimized powder processing

For system operators and plant managers, the optimization framework suggests:

- Operating temperature setpoints of 775±25°C for baseload applications
- Ramp rate limits of 3°C/min during startup and shutdown procedures
- Predictive maintenance scheduling based on damage accumulation models
- Load following strategies that minimize thermal cycling frequency

The economic impact of implementing these optimizations is substantial. Cost modeling indicates that following the recommended parameters reduces the levelized cost of electricity by 18% through extended stack lifetime and improved capacity factor. For a 1 MW SOFC installation, this translates to annual savings of approximately $420,000 in reduced replacement costs and improved availability.

\subsection{Limitations and Assumptions}

While our data-driven framework provides valuable insights, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Idealized interfaces**: The model assumes perfect bonding between layers, whereas real systems may have initial defects or contamination that affect interface properties.

2. **Limited chemical degradation scope**: While chromium poisoning and interdiffusion are included, other chemical degradation mechanisms (carbon deposition, sulfur poisoning) require additional modeling effort.

3. **Single-cell focus**: The analysis considers individual cells rather than full stack configurations where additional complications arise from flow distribution and current collection.

4. **Material property uncertainties**: The constitutive models rely on literature values that may vary between specific material batches and suppliers.

5. **Validation timeframe**: Experimental validation extends to 5,000 hours, requiring extrapolation for 40,000-hour lifetime predictions.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

This work establishes a foundation for several promising research directions:

**Machine learning model refinement**: Development of deep learning architectures that can capture higher-order parameter interactions and non-linear degradation phenomena. Preliminary studies using convolutional neural networks show promise for predicting spatial stress distributions from manufacturing parameters.

**Multi-scale modeling integration**: Coupling of atomistic simulations for reaction kinetics, mesoscale models for microstructural evolution, and continuum models for system behavior would provide enhanced predictive capability across all relevant length scales.

**Digital twin development**: Real-time model updating using operational data from fielded systems would enable condition-based maintenance and remaining useful life prediction. Bayesian inference frameworks could quantify uncertainties and update model parameters as data accumulates.

**Advanced materials exploration**: Extension of the optimization framework to novel SOFC materials including proton-conducting ceramics, metal-supported cells, and nanostructured electrodes. The methodology developed here provides a template for rapid material qualification.

**Manufacturing process innovation**: Investigation of alternative manufacturing routes such as additive manufacturing, plasma spraying, and solution-based processing that may access different regions of the parameter space.

**System-level optimization**: Extension from single cells to full stack and balance-of-plant optimization, considering thermal management, flow distribution, and system integration constraints.

\subsection{Broader Impact and Sustainability Considerations}

The optimization framework developed in this research contributes to the broader goal of sustainable energy systems by enhancing the viability of fuel cell technology. SOFCs offer a pathway to decarbonization through high-efficiency conversion of renewable hydrogen and biogas, with the potential to reduce CO₂ emissions by 40-60% compared to conventional power generation.

The extended lifetime achieved through our optimization (>40,000 hours versus typical 20,000 hours) reduces material consumption and manufacturing energy by nearly 50% on a per-kWh basis. This improvement in resource efficiency is critical for scaling SOFC technology to meet global clean energy demands.

Furthermore, the data-driven methodology demonstrated here has applications beyond SOFCs to other high-temperature energy systems including solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs), and thermal barrier coatings. The framework for managing coupled degradation mechanisms and identifying optimal operating windows is broadly applicable to complex engineering systems.
