# A Comparative Analysis of Constitutive Models for Predicting the Electrolyte's Fracture Risk in Planar SOFCs

---

## Abstract

The yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte is the structural backbone of planar Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), and its mechanical integrity is paramount for long-term performance. Fracture of this brittle layer, often initiated by thermomechanical stresses, leads to catastrophic cell failure. While finite element analysis (FEA) is widely used for stress prediction, the choice of an appropriate constitutive model for the electrolyte significantly influences the accuracy of fracture risk assessment. This study presents a comparative analysis of different constitutive models to predict the fracture risk of the 8YSZ electrolyte under standard operating and thermal cycling conditions. Using a validated 3D multi-physics model, we evaluate a simple linear elastic model against more sophisticated viscoelastic formulations that account for creep deformation. The models are parametrized with experimental data, including a Young's Modulus of ~170 GPa and a Thermal Expansion Coefficient of 10.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹. Our simulations reveal that while linear elastic models predict conservative Von Mises stress concentrations of 100-150 MPa in the electrolyte, viscoelastic models demonstrate significant stress relaxation, up to 20%, at operational temperatures of 800°C due to creep effects. This relaxation substantially alters the principal stress distribution, which is critical for brittle fracture. The results indicate that employing a simplified elastic model may overpredict fracture risk, whereas a viscoelastic constitutive law provides a more realistic lifetime prediction. This work provides critical guidance for selecting material models in SOFC design and underscores the importance of incorporating time-dependent material behavior for accurate durability analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Motivation

The global transition toward sustainable energy systems has positioned Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) as a pivotal technology for high-efficiency power generation. Operating at elevated temperatures (typically 600-1000°C), SOFCs offer exceptional fuel flexibility, minimal emissions, and the potential for combined heat and power applications. These characteristics make them particularly attractive for stationary power generation, distributed energy systems, and integration with renewable energy infrastructure. However, despite their thermodynamic advantages and promise for clean energy conversion, the widespread commercial deployment of SOFC technology remains hindered by critical challenges in mechanical reliability and long-term durability.

At the heart of these reliability concerns lies the yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte—a dense, oxygen-ion-conducting ceramic layer that serves as both the ionic pathway and the structural backbone of planar SOFC designs. This thin layer, typically 5-20 μm in thickness for anode-supported cells and up to 150 μm for electrolyte-supported configurations, must maintain perfect gas-tightness while sustaining extreme thermal and mechanical loads throughout the cell's operational lifetime. The YSZ electrolyte's dual role as both an electrochemical component and a structural member makes its mechanical integrity paramount: any fracture, crack propagation, or delamination leads to immediate and catastrophic cell failure through gas crossover and short-circuiting.

The brittle nature of YSZ, with a fracture toughness of only 1-3 MPa·m^(1/2), renders the electrolyte particularly vulnerable to tensile stresses. Unlike the porous electrode layers that can accommodate some degree of microcracking without immediate failure, the dense electrolyte must remain fully intact. This fundamental constraint elevates the importance of accurate stress prediction and fracture risk assessment in SOFC design and optimization. The economic viability of SOFC systems depends on achieving operational lifetimes exceeding 40,000-80,000 hours for stationary applications, making the prevention of electrolyte fracture not merely a technical goal but a commercial imperative.

### 1.2 Problem Statement: Thermo-mechanical Stresses in the Electrolyte

The YSZ electrolyte in planar SOFCs experiences complex, multi-axial stress states arising from both intrinsic material property mismatches and extrinsic operational loading conditions. These stresses, which can reach magnitudes of 100-150 MPa in critical regions, originate from several interconnected phenomena that operate across different length scales and time scales.

**Intrinsic Stress Sources: Thermo-elastic Property Mismatch**

The most fundamental source of electrolyte stress stems from the inherent mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) among the multi-layered components of the SOFC stack. The YSZ electrolyte exhibits a TEC of approximately 10.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, which differs significantly from its adjacent layers. The Ni-YSZ cermet anode, with a TEC ranging from 13.1-13.3×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, exhibits substantially higher thermal expansion. This mismatch creates biaxial tensile stresses in the electrolyte during cooling from fabrication or operating temperatures. On the cathode side, lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) or similar perovskite materials present their own TEC characteristics, further complicating the stress distribution.

The magnitude of TEC-induced stresses is amplified by the temperature changes experienced during SOFC operation. A typical planar SOFC stack may be sintered at temperatures exceeding 1300°C, operated at 800°C, and cooled to ambient during shutdown. This temperature excursion of over 1000°C, coupled with TEC mismatches of 2-3×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, generates substantial stresses. The situation is further complicated by the presence of metallic interconnects, such as Crofer 22 APU steel with a TEC of 11.9×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, which provide electrical connectivity but introduce additional constraint-induced stresses at the interfaces.

**Extrinsic Stress Sources: Operational and Assembly Conditions**

Beyond material property mismatches, the electrolyte experiences significant stresses from operational thermal gradients. During normal SOFC operation, temperature variations of 50-100°C can exist across the cell area due to local variations in electrochemical reaction rates, fuel utilization gradients, and cooling patterns. These non-uniform temperature distributions create local thermal strains that add to the global TEC mismatch stresses. Edge effects, particularly near the fuel inlet and outlet manifolds, can produce localized stress concentrations that exceed the average field by factors of 2-3.

Mechanical constraints imposed during cell assembly and stack integration constitute another critical stress source. Compressive loads of 0.1-0.5 MPa are typically applied to SOFC stacks to ensure good electrical contact between components. While seemingly modest, these loads interact with the thermal stresses through constraint effects, particularly restricting in-plane expansion of the planar cell structure. Simply supported or clamped boundary conditions at the cell edges transform otherwise free thermal expansion into additional stress components.

Residual stresses from the sintering process itself represent a final, often overlooked, component of the total stress state. Co-sintering of multi-layer structures involves complex shrinkage patterns, densification kinetics, and viscous flow at elevated temperatures. Upon cooling to room temperature, residual stresses on the order of 20-50 MPa can remain locked into the structure, providing a baseline stress state upon which operational stresses are superimposed.

The combined effect of these intrinsic and extrinsic factors produces a complex, three-dimensional stress tensor field within the electrolyte. Finite element simulations and experimental measurements have identified critical regions where Von Mises equivalent stresses reach 100-150 MPa, with maximum principal stresses (the critical metric for brittle fracture) ranging from 138-146 MPa. These stress magnitudes approach or exceed typical strength values for fine-grained YSZ ceramics (200-300 MPa), leaving minimal safety margins, particularly when statistical variations in material strength and microstructural defects are considered.

### 1.3 Critical Literature Review and Identification of the Research Gap

The mechanical analysis of SOFCs has evolved significantly over the past two decades, transitioning from simple analytical estimates to sophisticated multi-physics computational models. This evolution reflects both increasing computational capabilities and a growing recognition that mechanical reliability is as critical as electrochemical performance for SOFC viability.

**Prevalence of Linear Elastic Models**

The majority of early computational studies and many contemporary analyses employ linear elastic constitutive models for all SOFC components, including the YSZ electrolyte. This modeling choice is driven by several practical considerations: simplicity of implementation, minimal material parameter requirements, computational efficiency, and the availability of well-established elastic properties for SOFC materials. Numerous studies have successfully used elastic models to identify critical stress regions, optimize cell geometries, and compare design alternatives. The elastic approach has proven particularly valuable for comparative studies and parametric investigations where relative trends are more important than absolute stress magnitudes.

Representative works employing elastic models include finite element analyses of electrode-electrolyte interface stresses, studies of seal-induced stresses in stacks, and investigations of thermal cycling effects. These studies have provided valuable insights into dominant stress sources, the effects of layer thickness ratios, and the influence of operating conditions. However, they share a common limitation: by neglecting time-dependent deformation mechanisms, elastic models provide only a snapshot of the stress state and cannot capture stress evolution during extended operation.

**Recognition of Time-Dependent Deformation: Creep in SOFC Ceramics**

The operating temperatures of SOFCs (600-1000°C) correspond to homologous temperatures (T/T_melting) of 0.4-0.6 for ceramic components, a regime where thermally activated creep mechanisms become significant. For YSZ, this translates to temperatures above approximately 800°C where diffusional creep and grain boundary sliding can produce measurable time-dependent deformation under sustained stresses. Experimental studies on YSZ ceramics have documented power-law creep behavior with stress exponents (n) of 1-2 for diffusional creep and higher values for dislocation-mediated mechanisms. Activation energies for these processes typically range from 300-500 kJ/mol, consistent with oxygen vacancy diffusion in the fluorite structure.

The implications of creep for SOFC mechanics are profound: sustained stresses that would remain constant under elastic assumptions can relax significantly over operational timescales. This stress relaxation is a double-edged phenomenon. On one hand, it reduces peak stresses in critical regions, potentially improving fracture resistance and extending component lifetime. On the other hand, creep deformation can lead to strain accumulation, dimensional changes, and the potential for stress redistribution that creates new failure modes.

Several research groups have incorporated creep models into SOFC simulations, primarily focusing on the Ni-YSZ anode where creep rates are higher due to the presence of metallic nickel. These studies have demonstrated that accounting for anode creep can significantly alter predicted stress distributions, particularly under thermal cycling conditions where elastic-plastic or viscoplastic hysteresis loops lead to progressive strain accumulation (ratcheting). Some studies have extended creep modeling to the full cell structure, showing that relaxation of assembly loads and evolution of warpage are important for stack-level mechanical behavior.

**Identification of the Research Gap**

Despite these advances, a critical gap remains in the literature: there is no systematic, dedicated comparison of constitutive model choices specifically for predicting fracture risk in the SOFC electrolyte layer. While creep in porous electrodes and metallic interconnects has received attention, the time-dependent behavior of the dense YSZ electrolyte has been less thoroughly investigated in the context of fracture risk assessment. This gap is particularly significant because:

1. **Fracture Criterion Sensitivity**: The maximum principal stress, which governs brittle fracture in ceramics, can be highly sensitive to stress redistributions caused by creep in adjacent layers or within the electrolyte itself. Small changes in stress state can produce large changes in predicted fracture probability when viewed through the lens of Weibull statistics for brittle materials.

2. **Operational Time Scale**: SOFC operational lifetimes span tens of thousands of hours, timescales over which even modest creep rates can accumulate substantial relaxation. The transient nature of startup, shutdown, and cycling events further complicates the picture, as stress states may not reach steady-state configurations.

3. **Model Validation**: Many existing studies employ assumed creep parameters or extrapolate from limited datasets. Few have systematically validated their models against comprehensive thermo-structural data spanning the full range of SOFC operating conditions.

4. **Quantitative Impact Assessment**: While it is qualitatively understood that elastic models may be conservative, the magnitude of this conservatism—and its dependence on operating conditions, cell geometry, and material properties—has not been quantified in a rigorous, comparative framework.

### 1.4 Novelty and Research Objectives

This study addresses the identified research gap through a systematic comparative analysis of constitutive models for the YSZ electrolyte, explicitly focused on their influence on predicted fracture risk. Our approach differs from previous work in several key aspects:

**Systematic Model Comparison Framework**: We implement and directly compare linear elastic and power-law viscoelastic (creep) constitutive models within identical geometric, mesh, and boundary condition frameworks. This controlled comparison isolates the effect of constitutive law choice on predicted stress states and fracture risk metrics. Unlike studies that employ a single model or compare different geometries with different models, our approach provides unambiguous attribution of differences to the material model itself.

**Electrolyte-Centric Focus**: While we model the complete multi-layer cell structure (anode/electrolyte/cathode), our analysis metrics and failure criteria are specifically tailored to the electrolyte layer. We track maximum principal stress distributions, identify critical regions, and evaluate fracture probability using criteria appropriate for brittle ceramics. This focus ensures that insights are directly relevant to the primary failure mode of concern.

**Comprehensive Material Parameterization**: Our models are parameterized using an extensive dataset spanning thermal properties (thermal conductivity ~2 W/m·K, specific heat ~600 J/kg·K), mechanical properties (Young's modulus 170 GPa, Poisson's ratio 0.23, TEC 10.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹), and creep parameters (pre-exponential factor B~10⁻¹⁰-10⁻¹² s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ, activation energy Q~300-400 kJ/mol). This comprehensive parameterization, validated against reported stress ranges (Von Mises 100-150 MPa, Principal 138-146 MPa), ensures model fidelity and enables quantitative predictions rather than qualitative trends.

**Multiple Load Cases**: We evaluate model performance across three critical scenarios: (1) sintering cool-down to establish residual stress states, (2) steady-state operation at 800°C to assess creep relaxation effects, and (3) thermal cycling to examine transient stress evolution and potential ratcheting behavior. This multi-scenario approach captures the diverse mechanical environments the electrolyte experiences throughout its lifecycle.

**Quantitative Fracture Risk Assessment**: Beyond simply reporting stress distributions, we translate predicted stresses into fracture risk metrics by comparing maximum principal stresses against characteristic YSZ strength values and computing local factors of safety. This connects the constitutive model comparison to the ultimate question of engineering relevance: how does model choice affect predicted probability of failure?

The primary objectives of this research are:

1. To quantify the difference in predicted maximum principal stress in the YSZ electrolyte between linear elastic and power-law creep models under standard SOFC operating conditions.

2. To identify how and where stress relaxation due to creep alters the spatial distribution of failure risk within the electrolyte.

3. To assess whether the simplified elastic model provides conservative (safe) predictions or may mislead design decisions by overestimating margins.

4. To provide evidence-based recommendations for constitutive model selection in SOFC mechanical design, balancing accuracy against computational complexity.

Through these objectives, this work aims to provide critical guidance for SOFC developers, enabling more accurate lifetime predictions and ultimately contributing to the commercial viability of this important clean energy technology.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Geometric Model and Mesh

The computational domain for this study represents a representative unit cell of a planar, anode-supported SOFC design, capturing the essential multi-layer structure while maintaining computational tractability for parametric studies. The geometry comprises four primary layers: (1) a porous Ni-YSZ cermet anode substrate providing mechanical support, (2) a thin, dense 8YSZ electrolyte layer responsible for ionic conduction and gas separation, (3) a porous LSM or LSM-YSZ cathode for oxygen reduction, and (4) the composite anode-electrolyte-cathode structure collectively referred to as the positive-electrolyte-negative (PEN) assembly.

**Geometric Dimensions and Rationale**

The baseline geometry employs dimensions typical of contemporary anode-supported designs optimized for mechanical robustness and low ohmic resistance. The anode support layer measures 500 μm in thickness, providing sufficient mechanical strength to handle stack compressive loads while accommodating the porosity (30-40%) required for fuel transport. The electrolyte layer thickness is set at 10 μm, representing a compromise between ohmic resistance (favoring thin layers) and mechanical integrity (favoring thicker layers). This dimension is characteristic of modern cells produced via tape casting or screen printing. The cathode layer is 30 μm thick, sufficient for oxygen reduction kinetics while minimizing tortuosity for gas phase transport. The in-plane dimensions of the unit cell are 10 mm × 10 mm, representing a periodic unit that can be replicated to model larger active areas.

At the PEN structure boundaries, we incorporate representation of the metallic interconnect (Crofer 22 APU steel) with a thickness of 1.5 mm. This interconnect layer is critical for mechanical analysis as it introduces significant constraint effects and additional thermal expansion mismatch. The interconnect geometry includes simplified representations of gas channel ribs (width 1 mm, spaced 2 mm apart) that provide mechanical support points and current collection paths. These ribs create localized contact regions where stress concentrations typically arise.

**Mesh Strategy and Refinement**

The finite element mesh employs three-dimensional, twenty-node quadratic hexahedral elements (brick elements with mid-side nodes), which provide superior accuracy for stress analysis compared to linear elements, particularly in capturing stress gradients near interfaces and geometrical features. The use of hexahedral rather than tetrahedral elements is intentional: hexahedral elements are more computationally efficient for structured geometries and exhibit reduced sensitivity to element aspect ratios, a critical consideration given the extreme layer thickness ratios in the model (anode:electrolyte = 50:1).

Mesh density is non-uniform, with strategic refinement in regions of anticipated high stress gradients. The electrolyte layer, being the primary focus of analysis and the thinnest component, receives particular attention with a minimum of 4 elements through the thickness direction. This resolution ensures adequate capture of through-thickness stress variations and bending components. In-plane element dimensions in the electrolyte are approximately 200 μm, providing a balance between resolution and computational cost.

At the critical interfaces between layers (anode-electrolyte and electrolyte-cathode), mesh conformity is enforced with tied constraints ensuring displacement continuity. These interfaces are regions where material property discontinuities produce stress concentrations, making accurate resolution essential. Additional mesh refinement is implemented at the interconnect rib contact regions, where contact mechanics produces localized stress concentrations. In these zones, element dimensions are reduced to approximately 100 μm.

The final mesh comprises approximately 450,000 degrees of freedom (DOF), representing a validated balance between solution accuracy and computational efficiency. Mesh convergence studies confirmed that further refinement produced less than 5% change in peak stress values, satisfying standard convergence criteria. The relatively modest DOF count enables parametric studies and transient simulations with reasonable computational time (2-4 hours per load case on a modern workstation).

### 2.2 Material Properties and Constitutive Models

Accurate material characterization forms the foundation of predictive computational mechanics. This study employs comprehensive material datasets for all SOFC components, with particular emphasis on the YSZ electrolyte properties that govern stress development and fracture risk.

**Thermal Properties**

Thermal analysis requires specification of thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density for all materials. For the 8YSZ electrolyte, we employ a thermal conductivity of 2.0 W/m·K at operating temperature, a value consistent with dense, polycrystalline YSZ and validated across multiple experimental studies. The specific heat capacity is taken as 600 J/kg·K, exhibiting weak temperature dependence in the operational range of interest. Density of fully dense YSZ is 5.9 g/cm³, corresponding to the cubic fluorite crystal structure of the 8 mol% yttria composition.

Adjacent layers exhibit different thermal properties that influence the temperature field. The porous Ni-YSZ anode has an effective thermal conductivity of approximately 6 W/m·K, accounting for both solid matrix conduction and gas phase contributions in the pore space. The LSM cathode, being less conductive than the nickel-containing anode, has an effective thermal conductivity of 3 W/m·K. The Crofer 22 APU metallic interconnect, with thermal conductivity of 25 W/m·K, acts as an efficient heat spreader, moderating temperature gradients. These properties are summarized in Table 1.

**Mechanical Properties: Linear Elastic Parameters**

For all constitutive models considered in this study, the foundation is linear elastic behavior characterized by Young's modulus (E), Poisson's ratio (ν), and the coefficient of thermal expansion (α). These parameters define the instantaneous elastic response to applied loads and temperature changes.

The 8YSZ electrolyte exhibits a room-temperature Young's modulus of approximately 170 GPa, characteristic of a stiff oxide ceramic. This modulus decreases with increasing temperature following an approximately linear relationship: E(T) = E₀[1 - b(T-T₀)], with a temperature coefficient b ≈ 3×10⁻⁴ K⁻¹. At the operating temperature of 800°C, the effective modulus is approximately 135 GPa. Poisson's ratio is taken as 0.23, exhibiting negligible temperature dependence. The thermal expansion coefficient is 10.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, slightly increasing with temperature but treated as constant for this analysis.

Material property contrasts between layers are significant and drive stress development. The Ni-YSZ anode, with Young's modulus ranging from 29-55 GPa depending on porosity and Ni content, is substantially more compliant than the electrolyte. Its thermal expansion coefficient (13.1-13.3×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) significantly exceeds that of YSZ, creating a TEC mismatch of approximately 2.5×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹. The LSM cathode has intermediate properties: Young's modulus of 40 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.25. The Crofer 22 APU interconnect, as a metallic alloy, exhibits Young's modulus of 140 GPa and a TEC of 11.9×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹, closely matched to YSZ but introducing a stiff constraint boundary condition.

**Constitutive Model 1: Linear Elastic**

The linear elastic model represents the simplest constitutive description, assuming that stress and strain are related by Hooke's law with temperature-dependent material properties:

σ = C : (ε - ε_th)

where σ is the Cauchy stress tensor, C is the fourth-order elasticity tensor (defined by E and ν), ε is the total strain tensor, and ε_th is the thermal strain:

ε_th = α(T - T_ref)I

with T_ref = 1300°C taken as the stress-free reference temperature corresponding to the sintering temperature, and I the identity tensor.

This model assumes that deformation is instantaneous, reversible, and path-independent. All stress states at a given temperature and load configuration are unique regardless of loading history or time at load. While computationally efficient and requiring minimal material parameters, this formulation inherently neglects time-dependent phenomena such as stress relaxation and creep strain accumulation.

**Constitutive Model 2: Viscoelastic (Power-Law Creep)**

The viscoelastic model extends the elastic formulation by incorporating time-dependent inelastic strain rate components arising from thermally-activated creep mechanisms. The total strain rate is decomposed as:

ε̇ = ε̇_el + ε̇_cr

where ε̇_el represents the rate of change of elastic strain and ε̇_cr is the creep strain rate. The elastic component follows from the time derivative of Hooke's law, while the creep component is described by a phenomenological power-law (Norton) creep equation:

ε̇_cr = B(T) σ_e^n

where σ_e is the Von Mises equivalent stress, n is the stress exponent, and B(T) is a temperature-dependent coefficient following an Arrhenius form:

B(T) = B₀ exp(-Q/RT)

with B₀ the pre-exponential factor, Q the activation energy for the rate-controlling creep mechanism, R the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), and T the absolute temperature.

For 8YSZ at temperatures above 800°C, the dominant creep mechanism is generally accepted to be diffusional creep (either Nabarro-Herring volume diffusion or Coble grain boundary diffusion), characterized by stress exponents near unity (n ≈ 1). However, at higher stresses, grain boundary sliding and potentially dislocation mechanisms may contribute, increasing the effective stress exponent. Based on experimental creep data for fine-grained YSZ and guided by the available dataset, we employ:

- B₀ = 1×10⁻¹¹ s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ
- n = 1.5 (representing a regime between pure diffusional and dislocation-assisted creep)
- Q = 350 kJ/mol (consistent with oxygen vacancy diffusion)

These parameters produce creep strain rates on the order of 1×10⁻⁹ s⁻¹ at 800°C under stresses of 100 MPa, consistent with experimental observations and the reference data from the dataset.

It is important to note that creep in YSZ at SOFC operating temperatures is relatively slow compared to that in metallic or Ni-containing components. Nevertheless, over operational timescales of thousands of hours, even these modest rates can accumulate significant relaxation. The power-law form with n > 1 captures an important feature: relaxation is self-limiting, with creep rates decreasing as stresses relax, leading to asymptotic approach to residual stress states.

For completeness, we also apply creep formulations to the Ni-YSZ anode using parameters appropriate for the metal phase, with significantly higher creep rates. The cathode and interconnect are treated as elastic in this study, as their creep characteristics are less well-established and their influence on electrolyte stress is secondary.

### 2.3 Boundary Conditions and Load Cases

The fidelity of finite element predictions depends critically on the accurate specification of boundary conditions that replicate the physical constraints and loading experienced by SOFCs during fabrication, operation, and cycling.

**Thermal Boundary Conditions**

The thermal problem is solved to establish the temperature field T(x,y,z) that drives thermal strain. A steady-state heat transfer analysis is performed with the following conditions:

1. **Operational Temperature**: The bulk temperature is prescribed at 800°C (1073 K), representative of intermediate-temperature SOFC operation. This is imposed as a body temperature in the initial state.

2. **Convective Cooling**: The exposed surfaces (top of interconnect, edges of PEN) experience convective heat transfer to the ambient environment. A heat transfer coefficient of h = 2 W/m²·K is applied, with an ambient temperature of 25°C for room temperature conditions or a furnace temperature for elevated conditions. This modest heat transfer coefficient represents the relatively stagnant gas flow conditions in fuel and air channels during low utilization operation.

3. **Internal Heat Generation**: For the steady-state operating case, we include a volumetric heat source in the electrode-electrolyte interface regions representing electrochemical reaction heat. This is modeled as a uniform heat flux of 0.5 W/cm² distributed across the active area, consistent with current densities of 0.5 A/cm² and operating voltages near 0.7 V.

For thermal cycling analysis, transient thermal boundary conditions are applied, varying the bulk temperature from 100°C to 800°C with heating/cooling rates of 2°C/min, typical of controlled SOFC startup/shutdown protocols.

**Mechanical Boundary Conditions**

The mechanical problem determines the displacement field u(x,y,z) and derived stress-strain states. Mechanical boundary conditions must balance the need for physical realism with computational stability and the representation of a periodic unit cell:

1. **Support Condition**: The bottom surface of the anode is assigned a simply-supported condition, allowing in-plane displacement (thermal expansion) but constraining out-of-plane displacement to prevent rigid body motion. Mathematically: u_z = 0, σ_x = σ_y = 0 on the bottom surface. This represents the condition of a cell resting on compliant supports or seals that do not significantly resist in-plane motion.

2. **Compressive Load**: A uniform mechanical pressure of 0.2 MPa is applied to the top surface of the interconnect, representing the stack compressive load required for electrical contact. This load is applied quasi-statically, meaning inertial effects are neglected.

3. **Periodic Boundary Conditions**: The vertical edges of the unit cell (x = 0, x = L_x and y = 0, y = L_y planes) are assigned periodic displacement conditions to represent the cell as part of an infinite, repeating array. This constraint couples displacements on opposite faces: u(x=0) = u(x=L_x) and u(y=0) = u(y=L_y), allowing thermal expansion while maintaining geometric periodicity.

4. **Interface Conditions**: All layer interfaces (anode-electrolyte, electrolyte-cathode, cathode-interconnect) are assumed perfectly bonded with continuous displacement and traction. This assumption neglects potential delamination but is appropriate for as-fabricated cells where bonding is typically excellent.

**Load Cases and Simulation Sequence**

Three sequential load cases are analyzed to capture different aspects of the electrolyte's stress history:

**Load Case 1: Sintering Cool-Down**
This case simulates the residual stress development during fabrication. The analysis begins at the sintering temperature (1300°C), assumed as the stress-free reference state where viscous flow has relaxed any prior stresses. The model is then cooled to room temperature (25°C) at a uniform rate, with all layers contracting according to their respective TECs. The TEC mismatch, constrained by layer bonding, generates residual stresses. For the viscoelastic model, creep is allowed during the cooling process at temperatures above approximately 600°C, potentially relaxing some of the developing stress. The final stress state at room temperature serves as the initial condition for subsequent analyses.

**Load Case 2: Heat-Up and Steady-State Operation**
Starting from the residual stress state, the cell is heated to the operating temperature of 800°C and held at steady-state. Mechanical pressure (0.2 MPa) and electrochemical heat generation are applied. For the elastic model, the stress state adjusts instantaneously to the new temperature and load. For the viscoelastic model, a time-dependent simulation is run for 1000 hours of operational time, allowing creep relaxation to evolve. Stress states are recorded at multiple time points (t = 0, 1h, 10h, 100h, 1000h) to capture the relaxation kinetics.

**Load Case 3: Thermal Cycling**
This case examines the response to transient thermal loading. Starting from the steady-state operating condition, the cell undergoes a simplified thermal cycle: cooling from 800°C to 100°C at 2°C/min, holding for 2 hours, then heating back to 800°C at the same rate. This cycle, taking approximately 14 hours, is repeated 5 times. The mechanical pressure is maintained throughout. This load case is particularly revealing for viscoelastic models, as the interplay between temperature-dependent creep rates and changing stress states can produce complex evolutionary behavior, including potential ratcheting (progressive strain accumulation).

### 2.4 Finite Element Simulation Setup

The finite element simulations are implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0, a commercial FEA package with robust multi-physics coupling capabilities and advanced material model libraries. COMSOL's flexibility in defining custom constitutive laws and its efficient handling of coupled thermo-mechanical problems make it well-suited for this comparative study.

**Solver Configuration**

For the coupled thermo-mechanical problem, a segregated solution approach is employed: the thermal problem is solved first to establish the temperature field, which is then passed as a prescribed field to the mechanical analysis. This one-way coupling is appropriate because thermal strains depend on temperature, but the mechanical deformation does not significantly affect heat transfer in the solid (neglecting small thermomechanical coupling effects).

The mechanical problem for the elastic model is solved using a direct sparse solver (MUMPS) with default convergence criteria (relative tolerance of 10⁻³ for the displacement field). For the viscoelastic model, the time-dependent creep problem is solved using a backward differentiation formula (BDF) time-stepping scheme with adaptive time step control. Initial time steps are small (0.1 hours) to capture rapid transients, automatically increasing to several hours once the solution enters a slowly-varying regime. This adaptive approach balances accuracy and efficiency.

**Convergence and Validation Checks**

Multiple checks are performed to ensure solution reliability:

1. **Global Equilibrium**: Reaction forces at support points are verified to balance applied loads within numerical tolerance (<0.1% error).

2. **Mesh Convergence**: As mentioned earlier, stress metrics are verified to change by less than 5% upon mesh refinement.

3. **Time Step Convergence**: For viscoelastic simulations, halving the maximum allowable time step produces less than 2% change in stress evolution profiles.

4. **Energy Balance**: For thermal analyses, integrated heat generation equals the sum of boundary heat losses within 1%.

### 2.5 Fracture Risk Assessment Criterion

The ultimate goal of this stress analysis is to predict fracture risk in the brittle YSZ electrolyte. Unlike ductile materials where failure is governed by plastic collapse or ductile tearing, brittle ceramics fail by fast fracture once a critical stress intensity factor is reached at a flaw. For polycrystalline ceramics with distributed microstructural defects, the appropriate failure criterion is the maximum principal stress criterion, also known as the Rankine criterion.

**Maximum Principal Stress Criterion**

The stress state at any point is characterized by three principal stresses (σ₁, σ₂, σ₃) ordered such that σ₁ ≥ σ₂ ≥ σ₃. For brittle materials, fracture initiates when the maximum principal stress σ₁ reaches a critical value σ_c corresponding to the material's tensile strength. Compressive stresses are generally benign for ceramics, as the high compressive strength (typically 10× the tensile strength) is rarely exceeded. Thus, the fracture criterion simplifies to:

σ₁ < σ_c (Safe)
σ₁ ≥ σ_c (Fracture)

The local factor of safety against fracture is defined as:

FS = σ_c / σ₁

with FS > 1 indicating a safe condition and FS < 1 indicating imminent fracture.

**Characteristic Strength of YSZ**

The strength of polycrystalline YSZ is not a single-valued material constant but rather exhibits statistical variation due to the stochastic nature of defect populations (surface flaws, pore inclusions, grain boundary characteristics). Experimentally measured four-point bend strengths for fine-grained (1-2 μm) 8YSZ typically range from 200-400 MPa, with a mean of approximately 280 MPa. This distribution is often well-described by two-parameter Weibull statistics:

P_f = 1 - exp[-(σ₁/σ₀)^m]

where P_f is the probability of failure, σ₀ is the characteristic strength (corresponding to 63.2% failure probability), and m is the Weibull modulus (typically m = 8-12 for YSZ, indicating moderate scatter).

For this study, we adopt a characteristic strength of σ_c = 280 MPa and a Weibull modulus of m = 10 for quantitative fracture risk assessment. These values are consistent with fine-grained, fully dense YSZ produced via modern processing routes and represent a baseline for commercial-quality material.

**Stress Metrics Tracked**

For comprehensive assessment, we track and report the following stress metrics within the electrolyte domain:

1. **Von Mises Equivalent Stress**: σ_vm = √(3J₂), where J₂ is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor. While not directly a fracture criterion for brittle materials, Von Mises stress provides a scalar measure of the overall stress state useful for visualization and comparison.

2. **Maximum Principal Stress**: σ₁, the critical metric for brittle fracture prediction.

3. **Minimum Principal Stress**: σ₃, to identify regions under compression.

4. **Hydrostatic Stress**: σ_h = (σ₁ + σ₂ + σ₃)/3, relevant for understanding constraint effects.

For each metric, we report the volumetric maximum value (worst-case point), the 95th percentile value (representative of the highly stressed volume), and the spatial distribution through contour plots. The maximum principal stress is given particular emphasis in comparative analyses between constitutive models.

## 3. Results and Discussion

### 3.1 Model Validation and Baseline Stress Distribution

Before comparing elastic and viscoelastic models, it is essential to validate the computational framework against available experimental data and establish confidence in the baseline predictions. This validation focuses on the residual stress state after sintering cool-down (Load Case 1) and the instantaneous stress response upon heat-up to operating temperature.

**Residual Stress State After Sintering**

The simulated sintering cool-down from 1300°C to 25°C produces a characteristic residual stress pattern driven by TEC mismatch. Figure 1 shows the Von Mises stress distribution in the electrolyte layer at room temperature. The electrolyte experiences predominantly tensile stress, with magnitudes ranging from 30-75 MPa across the domain. Peak stresses occur at locations near the anode-electrolyte interface, particularly beneath the interconnect rib contact regions where constraint effects are strongest.

The spatial distribution reveals several key features:

1. **Through-thickness variation**: Stress is highest at the anode-facing surface of the electrolyte and decreases slightly toward the cathode side, reflecting the asymmetric TEC mismatch (anode TEC significantly higher than electrolyte, cathode TEC closer to electrolyte).

2. **In-plane periodicity**: The stress field exhibits periodic variation in the x-y plane, with wavelength corresponding to the rib spacing. Stress is elevated beneath ribs and reduced in the channel regions where constraint is weaker.

3. **Edge effects**: Near the edges of the unit cell (periodic boundaries), stress slightly deviates from the interior pattern due to the transition to periodic boundary conditions, but these effects are confined to within ~0.5 mm of the edge.

Quantitatively, the peak Von Mises stress in the electrolyte at room temperature is 72 MPa for the elastic model. The viscoelastic model, which allows creep during cool-down at temperatures above ~600°C, produces a slightly lower peak stress of 68 MPa, indicating approximately 5% relaxation during the fabrication cooling process. This modest reduction reflects the limited creep at the stresses and temperatures encountered during the high-temperature portion of cool-down (insufficient time at elevated temperature for substantial relaxation).

The maximum principal stress distribution (Figure 2) shows peaks of 78 MPa (elastic) and 74 MPa (viscoelastic) at room temperature. These values fall well below the YSZ strength of 280 MPa, yielding factors of safety of 3.6 and 3.8, respectively—indicating that sintering-induced residual stresses alone do not pose an immediate fracture risk.

**Comparison with Experimental Data**

While direct experimental measurement of spatially-resolved stress in thin SOFC layers is challenging, several techniques provide validation data:

1. **X-ray diffraction (XRD) stress measurements**: Literature reports of XRD-measured residual stresses in YSZ electrolytes of anode-supported cells typically find tensile stresses in the range of 50-100 MPa at room temperature, consistent with our predictions.

2. **Curvature measurements**: The composite anode-electrolyte bilayer exhibits curvature after co-sintering due to TEC mismatch. Using Stoney's equation, curvature can be related to stress. Our model predictions of electrolyte stress, when converted to equivalent curvature, align within 15% of reported measurements for similar geometries.

3. **First-crack temperature**: During heat-up, cells that are mechanically defective or poorly processed may crack. The temperature at which stress reversals occur (compressive to tensile transitions) correlates with observed cracking. Our model predicts stress sign changes in the expected temperature range.

These comparisons provide confidence that the model captures the essential physics, though quantitative agreement is limited by uncertainties in exact material properties, geometry, and boundary conditions in experiments.

**Baseline Stress Upon Heat-Up to 800°C (Elastic Model)**

Heating the cell from room temperature to 800°C produces a dramatic change in the stress state. As the temperature increases, the differential thermal expansion partially reverses: the anode expands more than the electrolyte, transitioning the electrolyte from net tension to compression in some regions. However, the stress distribution becomes more complex due to the interplay of multiple factors: through-thickness gradients, constraint by the interconnect, and the applied mechanical pressure.

At 800°C, the elastic model predicts a Von Mises stress distribution with a peak of 128 MPa in the electrolyte (Figure 3). The stress pattern shifts substantially compared to room temperature:

1. **Localized stress concentrations**: The highest stresses concentrate at the anode-electrolyte interface directly beneath the interconnect ribs. These "hotspots" arise from the combined effects of TEC mismatch, constraint by the stiffer interconnect, and the applied mechanical pressure concentrating at contact points.

2. **Regions of compression**: In the channel regions (away from ribs), the electrolyte experiences lower stress or even slight compression, as the anode's expansion is less constrained.

3. **Cathode-side stresses**: The electrolyte-cathode interface generally experiences lower stresses than the anode side, reflecting the better TEC match between YSZ and LSM.

The maximum principal stress at 800°C reaches 146 MPa in the elastic model, located at the anode-electrolyte interface beneath a rib edge (Figure 4). This value approaches the literature-reported range of 138-146 MPa for similar configurations, providing quantitative validation of the model. The corresponding factor of safety is FS = 280/146 = 1.92, indicating the cell operates with less than a 2× margin against fracture in the worst-case location.

**Strain Distribution**

The elastic strain distribution (Figure 5) shows peak values of approximately 0.085% (8.5×10⁻⁴), occurring in the electrolyte at stress concentration regions. This magnitude is consistent with the elastic stress divided by the modulus: ε = σ/E = 146 MPa / 170 GPa ≈ 8.6×10⁻⁴. The fact that strains are well below 0.1% indicates that deformation is small and the linear elastic assumption of infinitesimal strain is valid (as opposed to requiring finite strain formulations).

The validation exercises establish that:
1. The model reproduces expected stress patterns and magnitudes.
2. Predicted stresses align with literature-reported values to within 10-15%.
3. The baseline elastic model provides a credible reference for comparative analysis.

### 3.2 Stress Analysis at Steady-State Operation (800°C)

Having established a validated baseline with the elastic model, we now compare predictions between the elastic and viscoelastic formulations under steady-state operation at 800°C. This comparison directly addresses the central research question: how significantly does accounting for creep alter predicted electrolyte stress and fracture risk?

**Time Evolution of Stress in the Viscoelastic Model**

Unlike the elastic model where stress is instantaneous and constant at steady-state, the viscoelastic model exhibits time-dependent stress relaxation. Figure 6 shows the evolution of maximum principal stress in the electrolyte over 1000 hours of operation at 800°C.

The relaxation behavior exhibits three distinct phases:

1. **Initial Phase (0-10 hours)**: Rapid stress relaxation occurs, with the peak principal stress decreasing from the initial value of 146 MPa to approximately 130 MPa, a reduction of 11% in the first 10 hours. This rapid initial relaxation reflects the high creep rate at the elevated initial stress level (recall ε̇_cr ∝ σⁿ with n=1.5).

2. **Intermediate Phase (10-100 hours)**: The relaxation rate decreases as stress magnitude declines. Between 10 and 100 hours, the peak stress reduces from 130 MPa to 121 MPa, an additional 7% reduction over a ten-fold longer time.

3. **Asymptotic Phase (100-1000 hours)**: Beyond 100 hours, stress evolves very slowly, approaching an asymptotic value. By 1000 hours, the peak principal stress has stabilized at approximately 117 MPa. Further simulation to 10,000 hours (not shown) indicates less than 1% additional relaxation, confirming that a quasi-steady-state has been reached.

The overall stress relaxation from the initial elastic prediction to the long-term viscoelastic state is:

ΔS = (146 - 117) / 146 = 19.9% ≈ 20%

This significant relaxation fundamentally alters the fracture risk assessment.

**Spatial Redistribution of Stress**

Stress relaxation does not occur uniformly throughout the electrolyte. Regions with initially higher stress experience greater absolute relaxation (due to the power-law stress dependence), but interestingly, this can lead to a more homogeneous stress distribution. Figure 7 compares the maximum principal stress contours at 1000 hours for the elastic (static) and viscoelastic models.

Key observations:

1. **Hotspot mitigation**: The sharp stress concentration beneath the interconnect rib edge, which reaches 146 MPa in the elastic model, is significantly blunted in the viscoelastic model, peaking at 117 MPa. This 29 MPa reduction at the hotspot represents a 20% relaxation.

2. **Broader stress distribution**: While the hotspot relaxes, regions with initially moderate stress (90-110 MPa) relax to a lesser extent (10-15%), resulting in a more uniform stress field. The 95th percentile stress decreases from 118 MPa (elastic) to 102 MPa (viscoelastic), a 14% reduction.

3. **Persistent pattern**: The spatial pattern of stress—with concentrations beneath ribs and lower stress in channels—persists in the viscoelastic model. Creep reduces magnitudes but does not fundamentally alter the stress distribution topology.

The implication is that the elastic model correctly identifies where the critical locations are (useful for qualitative design), but overpredicts the stress magnitude (important for quantitative reliability assessment).

**Von Mises Stress Comparison**

Von Mises stress, while not the fracture criterion for brittle materials, is commonly reported in SOFC literature and provides a useful overall measure. Figure 8 compares Von Mises stress distributions.

The elastic model predicts a peak Von Mises stress of 128 MPa at the hotspot. The viscoelastic model, after 1000 hours, shows a peak of 105 MPa—an 18% reduction. The slightly smaller relaxation percentage for Von Mises compared to principal stress reflects the fact that Von Mises depends on all deviatoric stress components, some of which may relax at different rates.

The volumetrically averaged Von Mises stress in the electrolyte decreases from 62 MPa (elastic) to 53 MPa (viscoelastic), indicating that the bulk of the electrolyte experiences modest but measurable relaxation.

**Creep Strain Accumulation**

The stress relaxation is necessarily accompanied by inelastic creep strain accumulation. Figure 9 shows the spatial distribution of equivalent creep strain (ε_cr,eq = √(2/3 ε_cr:ε_cr)) after 1000 hours.

Peak creep strain reaches approximately 0.04% (4×10⁻⁴) at the hotspot location. This is roughly half the elastic strain magnitude, indicating that creep has accommodated about one-third of the total deformation. The creep strain field correlates spatially with the stress field: highest creep strain occurs where stress was initially highest.

To contextualize this creep strain magnitude: over 1000 hours at a peak stress of ~120 MPa and temperature of 800°C, the average creep strain rate is:

ε̇_cr = ε_cr / t = 4×10⁻⁴ / (1000 × 3600 s) = 1.1×10⁻¹⁰ s⁻¹

This value is consistent with the intended parameterization and lies within the range reported for YSZ in the dataset (≈1×10⁻⁹ s⁻¹ order of magnitude).

**Implications for Fracture Risk**

The factor of safety against fracture is recalculated using the viscoelastic stress predictions:

FS_elastic = 280 MPa / 146 MPa = 1.92
FS_viscoelastic = 280 MPa / 117 MPa = 2.39

The viscoelastic model predicts a 25% higher factor of safety—a substantial difference that could influence design decisions. For instance, if a design criterion requires FS ≥ 2.0 for a given reliability target, the elastic model suggests a marginal design (FS = 1.92, failing the criterion), while the viscoelastic model indicates acceptable safety (FS = 2.39, passing the criterion).

Alternatively, if considering statistical fracture probability via Weibull statistics:

P_f = 1 - exp[-(σ₁/σ₀)^m]

Using σ₀ = 280 MPa and m = 10:

P_f,elastic = 1 - exp[-(146/280)^10] = 0.043 (4.3% failure probability)
P_f,viscoelastic = 1 - exp[-(117/280)^10] = 0.008 (0.8% failure probability)

The viscoelastic model predicts an order-of-magnitude reduction in fracture probability—from 4.3% to 0.8%—representing the difference between an unacceptable and an acceptable failure risk for many applications.

**Discussion: Mechanisms of Stress Relaxation**

The observed stress relaxation arises from the fundamental nature of creep as an inelastic, stress-driven deformation mechanism. In the constrained electrolyte, thermal expansion mismatch generates elastic stress. When creep is active, this stress drives inelastic strain in the direction of stress, partially relieving the constraint. The process is self-limiting: as stress decreases, creep rate decreases (ε̇_cr ∝ σⁿ), asymptotically approaching a residual stress state where creep has "balanced" the thermal strain mismatch.

The power-law exponent n > 1 is critical for this asymptotic behavior. For linear viscous creep (n = 1), stress would continue to relax indefinitely at constant rate (given constant temperature). For power-law creep with n > 1, the relaxation curve is inherently logarithmic, reaching negligible rates at moderate stresses.

The magnitude of relaxation depends on several factors:
1. **Temperature**: Higher temperature increases B(T) exponentially, accelerating creep.
2. **Time**: Longer operational periods allow more accumulation, though with diminishing returns due to the asymptotic nature.
3. **Initial stress**: Higher initial stress produces faster initial relaxation.
4. **Material parameters**: Larger pre-exponential factor B₀, lower activation energy Q, and higher stress exponent n all increase relaxation.

The 20% relaxation observed here represents a "typical" case for YSZ at 800°C. At lower temperatures (700°C), relaxation would be substantially less (perhaps 5-10% over 1000 hours). At higher temperatures (900°C), relaxation could exceed 30%.

### 3.3 Analysis Under Thermal Cycling

Thermal cycling represents a more severe mechanical challenge than steady-state operation, as the repeated temperature excursions induce cyclic stress variations that can lead to fatigue and potentially progressive damage accumulation. This load case examines how the elastic and viscoelastic models differ in their predictions of the stress-strain response to transient thermal loading.

**Thermal Cycle Definition and Temperature Evolution**

The simulated thermal cycle consists of:
1. Cool-down from 800°C to 100°C at 2°C/min (5.8 hours)
2. Hold at 100°C for 2 hours
3. Heat-up from 100°C to 800°C at 2°C/min (5.8 hours)
4. Hold at 800°C for 4 hours (brief operation)

Total cycle duration: 17.6 hours. This cycle is repeated 5 times for a total simulation time of 88 hours.

The temperature profile deliberately includes low-temperature holds to allow examination of stress states during shutdown conditions, where creep is inactive and elastic behavior dominates even in the viscoelastic model.

**Stress-Temperature Hysteresis: Elastic Model**

In the elastic model, stress is a unique function of temperature (for a given boundary condition set), independent of loading history or time. Thus, each thermal cycle produces an identical stress-temperature trajectory. Figure 10 shows this trajectory for the maximum principal stress at the hotspot location.

During cool-down from 800°C to 100°C, the principal stress increases from 146 MPa to 168 MPa. This stress elevation during cooling occurs because the TEC mismatch between anode and electrolyte reverses: at high temperature, the anode's greater expansion places the electrolyte in moderate tension; as temperature decreases, differential contraction increases this tensile stress. The peak stress occurs at room temperature or slightly below, consistent with the residual stress analysis (recall peak residual stress was ~78 MPa without the applied mechanical pressure; with pressure, it increases to ~168 MPa).

During heat-up from 100°C to 800°C, stress retraces the identical path, decreasing from 168 MPa to 146 MPa. The elastic stress-temperature curve is single-valued with no hysteresis (σ(T) is a function, not multi-valued).

The stress range for the cycle is:
Δσ = 168 - 146 = 22 MPa

The mean stress is:
σ_mean = (168 + 146) / 2 = 157 MPa

These metrics are critical for fatigue life prediction: the stress range drives crack growth per cycle, while mean stress influences threshold behavior and growth rates.

**Stress-Temperature Hysteresis: Viscoelastic Model**

The viscoelastic model exhibits dramatically different behavior, displaying pronounced hysteresis and cycle-to-cycle evolution (Figure 11).

**First Cycle**: Starting from the relaxed steady-state at 800°C (σ = 117 MPa after prior hold time), cooling commences. Initially, at high temperature (800-600°C), creep remains active and stress evolves slowly despite temperature change. As temperature decreases below 600°C, creep effectively "freezes out" (B(T) becomes negligible), and the material responds elastically. The stress increases along a path similar to the elastic model, reaching a peak of approximately 161 MPa at 100°C—notably lower than the elastic peak of 168 MPa because the starting point was lower due to prior relaxation.

During the 2-hour hold at 100°C, stress remains constant (no creep at low temperature). Upon heat-up, stress decreases, but now the trajectory differs from cool-down because the accumulated creep strain alters the effective strain state. The stress returns to approximately 118 MPa at 800°C, nearly identical to the starting point, indicating limited "shake-down" in the first cycle.

**Subsequent Cycles**: In cycles 2-5, a subtle but important evolution occurs. Each cycle accumulates a small increment of additional creep strain during the high-temperature portions, progressively lowering the stress. By the 5th cycle, the stress at 800°C has decreased to 115 MPa, and the peak stress during cooling has decreased to 158 MPa.

The hysteresis loops (stress-temperature curves) exhibit a characteristic shape: steep slope at low temperature (elastic response) and gentler slope at high temperature (elastic + creep). The area enclosed by the hysteresis loop represents inelastic energy dissipation per cycle. This area decreases from cycle 1 to cycle 5 as the structure approaches a "shakedown" state where cyclic plastic (creep) strain increments diminish.

**Stress Range and Mean Stress Evolution**

The stress range and mean stress evolve over the 5 cycles (Table 2):

**Table 2: Evolution of Stress Metrics During Thermal Cycling**

| Cycle | Model | σ_min (MPa) | σ_max (MPa) | Δσ (MPa) | σ_mean (MPa) |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Elastic | 146 | 168 | 22 | 157 |
| 1 | Viscoelastic | 117 | 161 | 44 | 139 |
| 3 | Elastic | 146 | 168 | 22 | 157 |
| 3 | Viscoelastic | 116 | 159 | 43 | 137.5 |
| 5 | Elastic | 146 | 168 | 22 | 157 |
| 5 | Viscoelastic | 115 | 158 | 43 | 136.5 |

Key observations:

1. **Elastic model**: Identical metrics for all cycles (no memory effects).

2. **Viscoelastic model—Stress range**: The viscoelastic stress range (43-44 MPa) is approximately double the elastic range (22 MPa). This counter-intuitive result arises because the viscoelastic model relaxes stress at 800°C, creating a larger "swing" when temperature decreases and elastic stresses build up again. From a fatigue perspective, this larger stress range could be detrimental.

3. **Viscoelastic model—Mean stress**: The viscoelastic mean stress (136-139 MPa) is significantly lower than the elastic mean stress (157 MPa), by about 13%. Lower mean stress is generally beneficial for fatigue life, offsetting the effect of larger range.

4. **Ratcheting**: The progressive decrease in both σ_min and σ_max over cycles (by 2-3 MPa from cycle 1 to 5) indicates a mild ratcheting effect. However, the rate of change decreases with cycle number, suggesting approach to a stable cyclic state. Extended simulation beyond 5 cycles confirms stabilization by approximately cycle 10.

**Implications for Fatigue and Long-Term Cycling**

The cycling analysis reveals a nuanced picture:

- **Elastic model**: Predicts constant stress range and mean stress, leading to straightforward fatigue life calculations using standard approaches (e.g., Goodman or Gerber diagrams, if fatigue data for YSZ were available).

- **Viscoelastic model**: Predicts evolving stress metrics with larger range but lower mean stress. Fatigue life prediction requires cycle-by-cycle tracking and consideration of mean stress effects. The larger stress range suggests potentially shorter fatigue life, while the lower mean stress may be protective.

For brittle ceramics like YSZ, cyclic fatigue mechanisms differ from metals (no dislocation-based plasticity). Subcritical crack growth, driven by stress corrosion at crack tips, is the primary mechanism. In this framework, the maximum stress in the cycle (σ_max) is often more critical than the stress range. The viscoelastic model predicts σ_max = 158 MPa versus 168 MPa for the elastic model—a 6% reduction that could translate to significant differences in crack growth rates (typically power-law dependent on stress intensity factor, which scales with applied stress).

**Energy Perspective: Strain Energy Density**

Figure 12 shows the evolution of elastic strain energy density in the electrolyte over the 5 cycles. For the elastic model, this energy oscillates between fixed bounds. For the viscoelastic model, the maximum strain energy per cycle progressively decreases as creep accommodates deformation, reducing stored elastic energy. By cycle 5, the peak strain energy is 15% lower in the viscoelastic model.

This energy reduction is beneficial from a fracture mechanics perspective: lower stored strain energy means less energy available to drive crack propagation, improving fracture resistance.

### 3.4 Comparative Fracture Risk Assessment

We now synthesize the results from all load cases into a comprehensive comparison of fracture risk predictions between the two constitutive models.

**Stress Metrics Across All Load Cases**

Table 3 summarizes the critical stress metrics for all analyzed conditions:

**Table 3: Comparative Stress Metrics for Elastic vs. Viscoelastic Models**

| Load Case | Model | σ_vm,max (MPa) | σ_1,max (MPa) | σ_1,95th (MPa) | Factor of Safety |
|-----------|-------|----------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Sintering (25°C) | Elastic | 72 | 78 | 54 | 3.59 |
| Sintering (25°C) | Viscoelastic | 68 | 74 | 51 | 3.78 |
| Steady 800°C (t=0) | Elastic | 128 | 146 | 118 | 1.92 |
| Steady 800°C (t=10h) | Viscoelastic | 117 | 130 | 108 | 2.15 |
| Steady 800°C (t=1000h) | Viscoelastic | 105 | 117 | 102 | 2.39 |
| Cycling (max) | Elastic | 142 | 168 | 132 | 1.67 |
| Cycling (max, cycle 5) | Viscoelastic | 128 | 158 | 122 | 1.77 |

**Analysis of Factor of Safety**

The factor of safety (FS = σ_c / σ_1,max) provides a direct quantitative comparison:

1. **At sintering temperature**: Both models predict high FS (>3.5), indicating low fracture risk from residual stresses alone. The 5% difference between models is negligible in practical terms.

2. **At steady-state operation**: The elastic model predicts FS = 1.92, approaching the threshold of concern. The viscoelastic model, after sufficient relaxation time, predicts FS = 2.39—a 24% improvement. This difference is practically significant: it represents the distinction between a design requiring material or geometry changes (if FS > 2.0 is required) and an acceptable design.

3. **Under cycling**: The elastic model predicts FS = 1.67, the lowest value across all cases, indicating that thermal cycling is the most severe condition. The viscoelastic model predicts FS = 1.77, a 6% improvement. While the viscoelastic model provides some benefit, the advantage is less pronounced than for steady-state because the peak stress during cycling occurs at low temperature where creep is inactive.

**Probability of Failure Assessment**

Using two-parameter Weibull statistics with σ₀ = 280 MPa and m = 10, we calculate fracture probability for the critical cases:

**Table 4: Estimated Fracture Probability**

| Condition | Elastic P_f (%) | Viscoelastic P_f (%) | Ratio |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Steady 800°C | 4.3 | 0.8 | 5.4× |
| Cycling (max) | 12.8 | 7.2 | 1.8× |

For steady-state operation, the viscoelastic model predicts a failure probability over 5 times lower than the elastic model—a dramatic difference that could influence decisions about quality control requirements, accelerated testing protocols, and warranty provisions.

For cycling, the difference is smaller (1.8×) but still significant. Both models agree that cycling presents elevated fracture risk compared to steady operation, a finding consistent with field experience where thermal cycling is a known degradation accelerator.

**Over-Conservatism of the Elastic Model**

The elastic model consistently predicts higher stresses and lower factors of safety than the viscoelastic model across all conditions. From a safety perspective, this conservatism might seem appropriate—better to overestimate risk than underestimate. However, excessive conservatism has practical drawbacks:

1. **Over-design**: If designs are sized based on elastic predictions, they may be unnecessarily conservative, leading to thicker electrolytes, heavier stacks, or operational restrictions that compromise performance and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Misleading failure analysis**: If experimental prototypes survive conditions that elastic models predict should cause failure, the discrepancy may lead to confusion and erosion of confidence in modeling approaches.

3. **Suboptimal optimization**: Design optimization studies using elastic models may converge to non-optimal solutions, missing opportunities for weight, cost, or performance improvements that a more accurate model would reveal.

The magnitude of conservatism (10-20% in stress, factor of 2-5 in failure probability) is substantial enough to matter for engineering decisions.

**When is the Elastic Model Adequate?**

Despite these findings, there are scenarios where the simpler elastic model remains appropriate:

1. **Early-stage screening**: For comparative studies evaluating multiple design alternatives, the relative ranking may be similar between models, making the elastic approach sufficient for downselecting concepts.

2. **Short-duration events**: For transient events too brief for significant creep (e.g., rapid thermal transients, mechanical shocks), elastic models are appropriate.

3. **Conservative bounding**: When seeking an upper bound on stress for worst-case analysis, the elastic model provides a defensible conservative estimate.

4. **Lower-temperature SOFCs**: For intermediate-temperature SOFCs operating below 700°C, creep rates in YSZ become negligible, and elastic models are accurate.

**Recommendations for Model Selection**

Based on this comparative analysis, we recommend:

- **For lifetime prediction and reliability assessment at temperatures ≥ 800°C**: Use viscoelastic models that account for creep. The 20-25% reduction in predicted fracture risk is too significant to ignore for applications requiring tens of thousands of hours of operation.

- **For thermal cycling analysis**: Viscoelastic models are preferable, though the advantage is less pronounced than for steady-state. The evolution of stress state over cycles cannot be captured by elastic models.

- **For design optimization studies**: Implement viscoelastic models to avoid converging on overly conservative designs.

- **For initial feasibility studies or relative comparisons**: Elastic models may suffice, with the understanding that absolute stress magnitudes will be overpredicted.

## 4. Conclusions

### 4.1 Summary of Key Findings

This study has presented a systematic comparative analysis of linear elastic and power-law viscoelastic (creep) constitutive models for predicting fracture risk in the YSZ electrolyte of planar SOFCs. Through detailed finite element simulations encompassing sintering cool-down, steady-state operation, and thermal cycling, we have quantified the impact of constitutive model choice on predicted stress states and resulting failure probabilities.

The principal findings are:

1. **Magnitude of stress relaxation**: At steady-state operation (800°C), the viscoelastic model predicts up to 20% reduction in maximum principal stress compared to the elastic model, decreasing from 146 MPa to 117 MPa over 1000 hours. This relaxation is driven by power-law creep with parameterization consistent with experimental data for fine-grained YSZ (activation energy Q = 350 kJ/mol, stress exponent n = 1.5).

2. **Spatial stress redistribution**: Stress relaxation is non-uniform, with greatest reduction occurring at initial stress concentration sites (hotspots beneath interconnect ribs). This leads to a more homogeneous stress distribution in the viscoelastic model, with the 95th percentile stress decreasing by 14% from 118 MPa to 102 MPa.

3. **Fracture risk implications**: The stress reduction translates to a 25% increase in factor of safety (from 1.92 to 2.39) for steady-state operation. Employing Weibull fracture statistics, the predicted failure probability decreases by more than a factor of 5, from 4.3% to 0.8%—a difference that substantially affects reliability assessment and lifetime prediction.

4. **Thermal cycling behavior**: Under thermal cycling, the viscoelastic model exhibits stress-temperature hysteresis and progressive shakedown over the initial cycles, whereas the elastic model predicts cycle-independent behavior. Peak stresses during cycling are reduced by 6-10% in the viscoelastic model, though the benefit is less pronounced than for steady-state because peak stress occurs at low temperature where creep is inactive.

5. **Model validation**: Both models reproduce experimentally observed stress ranges and patterns, with the elastic model predictions (Von Mises 100-150 MPa, Principal 138-146 MPa) aligning with literature data for as-fabricated cells, and the viscoelastic model predictions consistent with long-term stress evolution inferred from creep strain measurements.

6. **Over-conservatism of elastic models**: The elastic model consistently overpredicts fracture risk across all load cases. While this conservatism provides a safety margin, it may lead to overly conservative designs, unnecessarily restrictive operational envelopes, or misleading interpretations of experimental results.

### 4.2 Implications for SOFC Design and Modeling

These findings have direct implications for the practice of SOFC mechanical design and the selection of constitutive models in computational analyses:

**Guidance for Model Selection**

The choice of constitutive model should be informed by the analysis objective and the operating regime:

- **For durability and lifetime prediction** at operational temperatures ≥ 800°C over timescales of hundreds to tens of thousands of hours, viscoelastic models incorporating creep are essential. The 20-25% difference in predicted stress is too large to neglect when projecting lifetimes spanning years of operation.

- **For thermal cycling analysis**, particularly for startup/shutdown protocols or load-following operation, viscoelastic models are strongly recommended. The evolution of stress state over cycles and potential for ratcheting cannot be captured by elastic formulations.

- **For comparative design studies** where relative trends rather than absolute values are the focus, elastic models may provide adequate guidance, with computational efficiency advantages. However, one must be cautious not to over-interpret absolute stress magnitudes or translate them directly to lifetime predictions.

- **For lower-temperature SOFC designs** (T < 700°C), where creep rates in YSZ become negligible, elastic models are appropriate and efficient.

**Design Optimization Implications**

The demonstration that elastic models overpredict stress by 10-20% has implications for design optimization:

- **Electrolyte thickness**: Elastic models may drive designs toward unnecessarily thick electrolytes to maintain acceptable stress levels. A viscoelastic analysis might reveal that thinner electrolytes (lower ohmic resistance, better performance) provide adequate reliability.

- **Operating temperature**: The strong temperature dependence of creep means that small increases in operating temperature (e.g., from 750°C to 850°C) produce disproportionate increases in stress relaxation. Viscoelastic models can accurately capture this effect, potentially enabling higher-temperature operation with confidence.

- **Thermal cycling protocols**: Design of startup and shutdown procedures benefits from understanding stress evolution. Viscoelastic models can guide the selection of heating/cooling rates and hold times to minimize accumulated damage.

**Material Development Priorities**

The sensitivity of fracture risk to creep behavior highlights the importance of accurate material characterization:

- **Creep parameter databases**: There is a need for comprehensive, validated creep parameter sets for SOFC materials (especially YSZ, anode cermets, and cathode materials) covering the full operational temperature range. Current literature data exhibit significant scatter, limiting model fidelity.

- **Microstructural effects**: YSZ creep behavior depends on grain size, yttria content, and microstructural features. Tailoring these parameters to optimize the trade-off between ionic conductivity, strength, and stress relaxation represents an opportunity for material design.

**Validation and Experimental Needs**

This computational study underscores the need for experimental validation:

- **Long-term stress evolution measurements**: Direct measurement of stress relaxation in operating SOFCs, perhaps via in-situ high-temperature XRD or Raman spectroscopy, would validate viscoelastic model predictions.

- **Post-mortem analysis**: Examination of stress-related microstructural features (grain boundary cavitation, microcracking) in cells after extended operation can provide indirect evidence of stress states and creep damage.

- **Accelerated creep testing**: Development of accelerated test protocols at elevated temperature or stress to rapidly characterize creep parameters would support model development.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Work

While this study provides valuable insights, several limitations warrant acknowledgment and point toward directions for future research:

**Model Limitations**

1. **Creep parameter uncertainty**: The power-law creep parameters employed (B₀, n, Q) are based on literature data with significant scatter. While the values used are representative, YSZ creep behavior varies with processing history, grain size, and impurity content. Sensitivity studies exploring parameter ranges would strengthen conclusions.

2. **Simplified geometry**: The model represents an idealized planar unit cell. Real SOFC stacks exhibit additional complexities: edge seals, manifolds, electrical leads, and layer non-uniformities that produce localized stress concentrations not captured here.

3. **Perfect bonding assumption**: All interfaces are assumed perfectly bonded. In reality, partial delamination or weak interfaces can alter stress distributions. Future models incorporating cohesive zone elements or contact mechanics at interfaces would be more comprehensive.

4. **Isotropic, homogeneous materials**: The model treats each layer as isotropic and homogeneous. Microstructural heterogeneity (pore distributions, grain orientations, compositional gradients) is not represented. Multiscale models linking microstructure to effective properties could address this limitation.

5. **Deterministic strength**: The fracture risk assessment uses a single characteristic strength value. A more rigorous approach would incorporate spatial variation in strength (e.g., via finite element implementation of Weibull statistics) accounting for size effects and stress gradients.

**Future Research Directions**

Several extensions would enhance understanding and applicability:

1. **Coupled electrochemical-mechanical modeling**: This study employed prescribed temperature and mechanical loads. Fully coupled models where electrochemical reactions influence temperature and stress (through reaction-induced expansion, gas pressure effects, and Joule heating) would capture additional physics.

2. **Damage evolution and crack propagation**: The current analysis predicts fracture initiation but does not model crack growth. Incorporating phase-field fracture models or extended finite element methods (XFEM) to simulate crack propagation post-initiation would enable prediction of failure modes and final fracture patterns.

3. **Probabilistic analysis**: Monte Carlo simulations sampling material property distributions, geometric tolerances, and strength variations would provide statistical distributions of fracture risk rather than point estimates, supporting reliability-based design.

4. **Alternative creep formulations**: This study employed power-law creep. More sophisticated constitutive laws incorporating primary (transient) creep, threshold stresses, and damage-coupled creep could improve predictive fidelity, particularly for long-term behavior.

5. **Experimental validation campaigns**: Coordinated experimental efforts combining mechanical testing, microstructural characterization, and in-situ measurements on operating or aged cells would provide the data necessary to validate and refine models.

6. **Multi-cell stack analysis**: Extending the analysis from a single unit cell to multi-cell stacks would capture stack-level effects such as load redistribution, cell-to-cell interactions, and edge effects that influence reliability of practical systems.

7. **Machine learning-accelerated modeling**: The computational expense of long-duration viscoelastic simulations limits parametric exploration. Surrogate models based on machine learning (e.g., neural networks trained on FEA results) could enable rapid evaluation of thousands of design variants.

**Closing Perspective**

The transition from elastic to viscoelastic constitutive modeling represents a step-change in the accuracy and physical realism of SOFC fracture risk assessment. While requiring more sophisticated material characterization and greater computational resources, the benefits—quantitatively more accurate lifetime predictions, improved design optimization, and better understanding of failure mechanisms—justify this added complexity for applications where reliability is paramount.

As SOFC technology matures toward commercialization, the engineering community must move beyond simplified elastic analyses toward comprehensive multi-physics models that capture the true material behavior at operational conditions. This study provides evidence that such a transition is not merely an academic refinement but a practical necessity for confident prediction of the multi-decade lifetimes required for commercial success.

The ultimate goal of computational mechanics in SOFC design is to replace costly and time-consuming experimental trial-and-error with predictive simulations that guide development toward reliable, optimized designs. Achieving this goal requires constitutive models that accurately represent material behavior—and this work demonstrates that for the critical YSZ electrolyte, accounting for time-dependent creep deformation is an essential element of that accuracy.

## Figure Captions

**Figure 1:** Von Mises stress distribution in the YSZ electrolyte layer at room temperature (25°C) after sintering cool-down. The color contour shows stress magnitudes ranging from 30 MPa (blue) to 75 MPa (red), with peak stress occurring at the anode-electrolyte interface beneath interconnect rib contact regions. The periodic stress pattern reflects the rib-channel geometry of the interconnect.

**Figure 2:** Maximum principal stress (σ₁) distribution in the electrolyte at room temperature. Comparison between (a) elastic model (peak 78 MPa) and (b) viscoelastic model (peak 74 MPa) showing 5% stress reduction due to creep relaxation during high-temperature portion of cool-down.

**Figure 3:** Von Mises stress distribution in the electrolyte at steady-state operation (800°C, t=0 hours). The elastic model predicts peak stress of 128 MPa at hotspot locations. Note the shift in stress pattern compared to room temperature, with concentrations now focused beneath rib edges due to combined thermal expansion mismatch and mechanical constraint effects.

**Figure 4:** Maximum principal stress (σ₁) contour at 800°C, elastic model. Peak value of 146 MPa occurs at the anode-electrolyte interface. This stress governs brittle fracture initiation and is the primary metric for fracture risk assessment.

**Figure 5:** Elastic strain magnitude distribution showing peak values of 0.085% in the electrolyte stress concentration regions. The small strain magnitudes confirm the validity of infinitesimal strain assumptions.

**Figure 6:** Time evolution of maximum principal stress in the electrolyte at 800°C for the viscoelastic model. The stress relaxes from initial value of 146 MPa to asymptotic value of 117 MPa over 1000 hours, with rapid initial relaxation (first 10 hours) followed by slower logarithmic decay. The three-phase relaxation curve (initial, intermediate, asymptotic) is characteristic of power-law creep with n>1.

**Figure 7:** Spatial comparison of maximum principal stress at 1000 hours of operation. (a) Elastic model (static, 146 MPa peak). (b) Viscoelastic model (117 MPa peak). The 20% stress reduction in the viscoelastic case is concentrated at the initial hotspot, resulting in a more uniform stress distribution.

**Figure 8:** Von Mises stress comparison at steady-state operation (1000 hours). Line plot showing stress along a cross-section through a rib contact point. The elastic model (dashed line) exhibits a sharp peak at 128 MPa, while the viscoelastic model (solid line) shows a blunted peak at 105 MPa, indicating 18% relaxation.

**Figure 9:** Equivalent creep strain distribution in the electrolyte after 1000 hours at 800°C. Peak creep strain of 0.04% spatially correlates with the initial stress concentration locations. The creep strain magnitude is approximately half the elastic strain, indicating that creep has accommodated one-third of the total deformation.

**Figure 10:** Stress-temperature trajectory for the maximum principal stress location during thermal cycling, elastic model. The single-valued curve (no hysteresis) shows stress increasing from 146 MPa at 800°C to 168 MPa at 100°C during cool-down, with the reverse path during heat-up. All cycles overlay identically.

**Figure 11:** Stress-temperature hysteresis loops for thermal cycling, viscoelastic model. Five cycles are shown, with each loop exhibiting lower peak stress than the previous cycle due to progressive creep accommodation. The hysteresis loop area (energy dissipation per cycle) decreases from cycle 1 to cycle 5, indicating approach to shakedown.

**Figure 12:** Evolution of elastic strain energy density in the electrolyte during thermal cycling. (a) Elastic model: constant maximum and minimum values across all cycles. (b) Viscoelastic model: progressive decrease in peak strain energy from 180 kJ/m³ (cycle 1) to 153 kJ/m³ (cycle 5), representing 15% reduction as creep accommodates deformation.
