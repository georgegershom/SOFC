# Experimental Measurement Dataset (Synthetic)

This dataset is fully synthetic and fabricated to emulate realistic outputs from SOFC materials characterization workflows. Units and ranges match plausible values reported in literature.

Structure:
- DIC/: Digital Image Correlation synthetic outputs
- XRD/: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction synthetic outputs
- PostMortem/: Post-mortem microscopy and indentation synthetic outputs
- _meta/: Manifest and schema
