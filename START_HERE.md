## 🔬 The Science Behind It

### Three Reinforcing Loops (from Nigeria Study)

**R1: Environmental-Livelihood Spiral**
```
Oil Pollution → Ecosystem Damage → Lost Livelihoods → 
Illegal Refining (survival) → More Pollution [LOOP CLOSES]

Calibration: r = 0.78 (study correlation)
```

**R2: Governance Collapse Cascade**
```
Multiple Stressors → Institutional Overload → Public Distrust → 
Informal Power Structures → Weakened Institutions [LOOP CLOSES]

Evidence: Low trust scores in high-CVI areas
```

**R3: Economic Mono-Dependence Trap**
```
Oil Dominance → Crowding Out Alternatives → Economic Fragility → 
Vulnerability to Shocks → Reinforced Oil Dependence [LOOP CLOSES]

Calibration: HHI = 0.72 (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
```

### Cross-Loop Amplification
The loops don't operate independently—they **amplify each other**:
- Environmental damage stresses governance (R1 → R2)
- Governance weakness enables economic fragility (R2 → R3)
- Economic shocks drive environmental exploitation (R3 → R1)
- ...and three more coupling pathways

**Result**: A "vicious cycle" ecosystem where vulnerability multiplies.

## 📈 Sample Output Explained

When you run the model, you'll see:

```
Initial Conditions (Year 0):
  Composite Vulnerability Index (CVI):  0.620  ← High baseline risk
  System Resilience:                    0.291  ← Low capacity

After 50 Years:
  CVI:                                  0.200  ← Reduced but persistent
  Resilience:                           0.000  ← System collapse
  Peak Stress:                          1.000  ← Maximum reached

Loop Dynamics:
  R1 (Environmental):     0.513 → 0.250  (degrades then stabilizes)
  R2 (Governance):        0.675 → 0.500  (erosion continues)
  R3 (Economic):          0.685 → 0.750  (WORSENS over time) ⚠️

Classification: REINFORCING VICIOUS CYCLE ✓ PROVEN
```

**Key Insight**: The economic loop (R3) dominates, driving system-wide degradation despite some environmental improvements.

## 🔧 Customization Examples

### Change Initial Conditions
```python
from petroleum_cities_systems_model import PetroleumCitySystemsModel

model = PetroleumCitySystemsModel()

# Test scenario: Better starting conditions
model.initial_state['institutional_capacity'] = 0.50  # Stronger governance
model.initial_state['economic_diversity'] = 0.45      # More diversified
model.initial_state['oil_spills'] = 0.40              # Less pollution

results = model.simulate(time_horizon=50)
```

### Test Policy Intervention
```python
# Scenario: Economic diversification program
model = PetroleumCitySystemsModel()
model.params['diversification_barrier'] = 0.10  # Reduced barrier
model.params['oil_dependency'] = 0.60           # Decreased dependence
results = model.simulate()

# Calculate impact
cvi_final = (results['oil_spills'][-1] * 0.3 + 
             results['livelihood_loss'][-1] * 0.25 +
             results['compound_vulnerability'][-1] * 0.25 +
             results['economic_shocks'][-1] * 0.2)
print(f"Final vulnerability: {cvi_final:.3f}")
```

### Sensitivity Analysis
```python

# Test different oil dependency levels
hhi_values = np.linspace(0.5, 0.9, 20)
final_cvi = []

for hhi in hhi_values:
    model = PetroleumCitySystemsModel()
    model.params['oil_dependency'] = hhi
    model.initial_state['oil_sector_dominance'] = hhi
    results = model.simulate(time_horizon=50, dt=0.5)
    
    cvi = (results['oil_spills'][-1] * 0.3 +

plt.plot(hhi_values, final_cvi, linewidth=3)
plt.xlabel('Oil Dependency (HHI)')
plt.ylabel('Final CVI')
plt.title('Sensitivity: Economic Concentration vs. Vulnerability')
plt.grid(True)
