\section{Major Themes and Sub-Themes}

\subsection{Theme 1: Organizational Barriers as Innovation Inhibitors}

\subsubsection{Resource Constraints as Primary Barrier}
Participants consistently identified resource limitations as the most significant barrier to OI adoption. This theme validates the quantitative finding that resource barriers have the strongest negative effect on OI adoption.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Manufacturing SME Owner (Low OI, Low Digital Literacy):} "We know we need to collaborate with others, but we don't have the money to invest in partnerships. Banks won't lend to us because we are small. How can we do open innovation when we can't even afford basic equipment?" (Interview 12)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Agriculture SME Manager (Medium OI, Medium Digital Literacy):} "The biggest problem is working capital. We want to partner with research institutions, but we can't afford to send our people for training or buy the technology they recommend." (Interview 18)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Relational Trust Challenges}
Trust emerged as a critical relational barrier, particularly in cross-organizational collaborations:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Rural Retail SME Owner (Low OI, Low Digital Literacy):} "People here don't trust outsiders easily. We've been cheated before by suppliers who promised good deals but disappeared with our money. So we stick to what we know." (Interview 7)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Cultural Resistance to External Ideas}
Cultural factors, particularly traditional business practices, created resistance to external collaboration:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Manufacturing SME Owner (Medium OI, High Digital Literacy):} "Our family has been doing business this way for generations. My father taught me that you don't share your secrets with competitors. Open innovation sounds good in theory, but it's against our business culture." (Interview 15)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Theme 2: Digital Literacy as Barrier Mitigator}

\subsubsection{Communication Tools Breaking Isolation}
Digital communication tools emerged as particularly effective in overcoming relational barriers:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ICT SME Manager (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "WhatsApp groups and Zoom meetings have been game-changers for us. We can now collaborate with partners in Dar es Salaam without traveling. This has opened up so many opportunities that were previously impossible." (Interview 3)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Information Access Enabling Knowledge Acquisition}
Digital information literacy enabled SMEs to access external knowledge and market intelligence:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Urban Retail SME Owner (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "Google and industry websites give us so much information about trends and suppliers. Before, we were operating blindly. Now we can make informed decisions about partnerships." (Interview 9)
\end{quote>

\subsection{Theme 3: Sector-Specific Innovation Patterns}

\subsubsection{ICT Sector Digital Advantages}
ICT SMEs demonstrated distinct advantages in leveraging digital tools for OI:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ICT SME Founder (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "Being in tech means digital literacy is part of our DNA. We collaborate with developers worldwide through GitHub and Stack Overflow. Our sector makes it easier to adopt open innovation practices." (Interview 2)
\end{quote>

\subsubsection{Agriculture Sector Structural Challenges}
Agricultural SMEs faced unique structural barriers related to seasonality and geographical dispersion:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Agriculture SME Owner (Low OI, Medium Digital Literacy):} "Farming is seasonal, and our operations are spread across remote areas. Even with mobile phones, it's hard to coordinate with research institutions or suppliers during peak seasons." (Interview 21)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Theme 4: Location-Based Digital Divides}

\subsubsection{Urban Digital Infrastructure Advantages}
Urban SMEs benefited from better digital infrastructure and connectivity:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Urban Manufacturing SME Manager (Medium OI, High Digital Literacy):} "In Dar es Salaam, we have reliable internet and access to co-working spaces where we meet potential partners. This makes collaboration much easier than for our rural counterparts." (Interview 14)
\end{quote>

\subsubsection{Rural Infrastructure Constraints}
Rural SMEs faced significant infrastructure challenges that limited digital tool effectiveness:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Rural Agriculture SME Owner (Low OI, Low Digital Literacy):} "The internet is slow and expensive here. During rainy season, we lose connection for days. How can we do video calls or access online resources when the infrastructure is so poor?" (Interview 19)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Theme 5: Firm Size and Resource Dynamics}

\subsubsection{Medium SMEs Strategic Advantages}
Medium-sized SMEs demonstrated better capacity for strategic OI engagement:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Medium Manufacturing SME Owner (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "With 150 employees, we have dedicated IT staff and budget for digital tools. Small SMEs can't afford this level of investment in open innovation capabilities." (Interview 5)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Small SMEs Survival Focus}
Small SMEs prioritized basic survival over strategic innovation activities:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Small Retail SME Owner (Low OI, Medium Digital Literacy):} "We're just trying to survive day to day. Open innovation sounds fancy, but we need to focus on paying rent and buying stock. Maybe when we're bigger, we can think about collaboration." (Interview 11)
\end{quote>

\subsection{Theme 6: Government and Institutional Support}

\subsubsection{Policy Implementation Gaps}
While government policies exist, implementation challenges limited their effectiveness:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ICT SME Founder (Medium OI, High Digital Literacy):} "The National ICT Policy is good on paper, but the training programs are mostly in big cities. Small SMEs like ours in secondary towns don't benefit much from these initiatives." (Interview 1)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{SIDO and TCCIA Support}
Industry organizations provided valuable but limited support:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Manufacturing SME Owner (Medium OI, Medium Digital Literacy):} "SIDO has been helpful with some training, but they focus more on basic business skills than digital collaboration tools. We need more advanced support for open innovation." (Interview 16)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Theme 7: Cultural and Generational Dynamics}

\subsubsection{Generational Digital Divides}
Age differences significantly influenced digital literacy and OI attitudes:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Young ICT SME Owner (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "My father started this business 30 years ago with traditional methods. He doesn't understand why we need to collaborate online. The generation gap is real in family businesses like ours." (Interview 4)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Traditional vs. Modern Business Cultures}
The tension between traditional business practices and modern OI approaches emerged as a recurring theme:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Elderly Retail SME Owner (Low OI, Low Digital Literacy):} "In my time, business was about personal relationships and trust built over years. These young people want to collaborate with strangers online. I don't think it's safe or reliable." (Interview 13)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Theme 8: Future Aspirations and Development Needs}

\subsubsection{Digital Training Priorities}
Participants consistently emphasized the need for practical digital skills training:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Manufacturing SME Manager (Medium OI, Medium Digital Literacy):} "We need training that's specific to our industry and our level. Not fancy academic courses, but practical skills for using digital tools in our daily operations and collaboration." (Interview 17)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Policy and Infrastructure Recommendations}
SMEs provided specific recommendations for enhancing OI adoption:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{ICT SME Owner (High OI, High Digital Literacy):} "The government should invest in rural internet infrastructure and create digital innovation hubs. Also, reduce bureaucracy for SMEs trying to access research institutions." (Interview 6)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Emergent Insights}

\subsubsection{Digital Literacy Development Pathways}
The qualitative data revealed three distinct pathways through which SMEs develop digital literacy:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-Taught Learning:} Individual initiative and trial-and-error approaches
    \item \textbf{Peer Learning:} Knowledge sharing within business networks and clusters
    \item \textbf{Formal Training:} Structured programs through government or NGO initiatives
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{OI Adoption Trajectories}
SMEs exhibited different trajectories of OI adoption influenced by barrier-moderation dynamics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradual Adoption:} SMEs that slowly build digital capabilities while addressing barriers incrementally
    \item \textbf{Leapfrogging:} SMEs that rapidly adopt OI through significant digital investments
    \item \textbf{Stagnation:} SMEs trapped in low digital literacy and high barrier cycles
\end{itemize}
