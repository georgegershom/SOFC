EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the dominant reinforcing feedback 
loops in petroleum cities, focusing on the systemic vulnerabilities that create 
compound risks in oil-dependent urban areas.

KEY FINDINGS
------------
1. Current Composite Vulnerability Index: 0.698
2. Primary feedback loops identified:
   - R1 (Livelihood-Environment): Strength = 0.90
   - R2 (Governance Failure): Strength = 0.80
   - R3 (Economic Diversification): Strength = 0.72

SYSTEM DYNAMICS
---------------
The three reinforcing feedback loops create a complex web of systemic risk where:
- Environmental degradation leads to livelihood loss and increased vulnerability
- Governance failures erode institutional trust and capacity
- Economic mono-dependence creates fragility and reduces adaptive capacity

INTERCONNECTIONS
----------------
The loops are highly interconnected, with changes in one domain cascading and 
intensifying issues in others, perpetuating chronic vulnerability.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Target intervention points at loop intersections
2. Implement multi-sectoral approaches to break reinforcing cycles
3. Focus on building adaptive capacity across all domains
4. Monitor feedback loop strengths to prevent system collapse

METHODOLOGY
-----------
- Systems dynamics modeling
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis
- Sensitivity analysis for parameter identification
- Network analysis for structural understanding
- Policy scenario modeling for intervention design

This analysis provides a foundation for evidence-based policy interventions
aimed at building resilience in petroleum cities.
