## Usage Instructions

### Loading the Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load main dataset
df = pd.read_csv('fintech_ssa_distress_dataset.csv')

# Load data dictionary
data_dict = pd.read_csv('fintech_ssa_data_dictionary.csv')

# Convert date columns
df['quarter_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['quarter_date'])
df['founding_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['founding_date'])
```

### Example Analysis
```python
# Filter distressed companies
distressed = df[df['distress_flag'] == 1]

# Analyze by country
country_risk = df.groupby('country')['distress_flag'].mean()

# Early warning analysis
early_warnings = df[df['early_warning_signal'] == 1]

# Time series for a specific company
company_ts = df[df['company_id'] == 'FT_NGA_0001'].sort_values('quarter')
```

## Data Generation Methodology

### Realistic Patterns Simulated
1. **Growth trajectories** vary by:
   - Company stage (Seed to Mature)
   - Market size (small/medium/large)
   - Regulatory environment strength
   - FinTech category

2. **Distress patterns** include:
   - Gradual decline over 4-6 quarters before failure
   - Increased churn rates
   - Revenue volatility
   - Funding difficulties

3. **Market dynamics**:
   - Higher growth in large markets (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa)
   - Category-specific transaction patterns
   - Regulatory events (2% probability per quarter)

### Key Assumptions
- Base failure rates: 35% (Seed), 25% (Series A), 15% (Series B), 8% (Series C+), 5% (Mature)
- Quarterly growth rates: 6-10% for healthy companies
- Churn rates: 2-8% baseline, up to 25% when distressed
- Customer acquisition costs vary by category

## Research Applications

This dataset is suitable for:
1. **Early Warning Model Development**
   - Binary classification models for distress prediction
   - Time series forecasting of failure risk
   - Survival analysis

2. **Risk Factor Analysis**
   - Identifying key predictors of FinTech failure
   - Country-specific risk assessment
   - Category-specific vulnerabilities

3. **Policy Research**
   - Regulatory environment impact analysis
   - Market development studies
   - Financial inclusion research

## Statistical Summary

### Distress Statistics
- Companies experiencing distress: 115 (23.0%)
- Average time to failure: 12 quarters
- Early warning accuracy potential: ~84% of distressed companies show warning signals

### Latest Quarter Metrics (Q20)
- Average Revenue: $108.5M
- Average Active Users: 4.95M
- Average Churn Rate: 7.23%
- Companies with Early Warning Signals: 16.8%

## Limitations and Disclaimers

1. **Synthetic Data**: This is fabricated data for research purposes only
2. **Simplified Patterns**: Real-world dynamics are more complex
3. **Coverage Gaps**: Does not include all SSA countries or FinTech categories
4. **Time Period**: Limited to 5-year window (2019-2023)
5. **Regulatory Simplification**: Regulatory environments are more nuanced in reality

## Reproducibility

The dataset can be regenerated using the provided Python script:
```bash
python3 fintech_ssa_dataset_generator.py
```

The random seed is fixed (42) for reproducibility. Modify the generator parameters to create variations:
- `n_companies`: Number of companies to generate
- `n_quarters`: Number of quarterly observations
- Country weights and categories can be adjusted in the class initialization
