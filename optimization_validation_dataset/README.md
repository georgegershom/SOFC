# üìê Optimization and Validation Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This dataset contains synthetic data for inverse modeling and PSO-based defect identification in materials engineering applications.

## Contents

### 1. FEM vs Experimental Data (`fem_experimental_comparison/`)
- Stress profiles under different loading conditions
- Strain measurements at various points
- Temperature-dependent material properties

### 2. Crack Depth Analysis (`crack_depth_analysis/`)
- Synchrotron XRD measurements
- Model predictions using different techniques
- Validation metrics and error analysis

### 3. Sintering Parameters (`sintering_optimization/`)
- Cooling rate optimization (1-2¬∞C/min range)
- Temperature profiles
- Material property evolution

### 4. Geometric Design Variations (`geometric_designs/`)
- Bow-shaped channel designs
- Rectangular channel designs
- Performance metrics for each design

## Data Format
- CSV files for tabular data
- JSON files for structured parameters
- NPY files for array data (stress/strain fields)

## Usage
Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific details about the data format and usage instructions.
