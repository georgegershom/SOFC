title: "Multi-Scale FEM Validation Dataset for SOFC Electrolytes"
version: 1.0.0
date-released: 2025-10-08
abstract: >
  This comprehensive dataset provides experimental measurements, 
  high-fidelity FEM simulation outputs, and multi-scale material 
  characterization data for validating Finite Element Method models 
  of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrolytes. The dataset includes 
  residual stress measurements (XRD, Raman, Synchrotron), crack 
  initiation and propagation data, full-field FEM solutions, 
  strategically selected collocation points for surrogate modeling, 
  and microstructure characterization from macro to micro scales.
