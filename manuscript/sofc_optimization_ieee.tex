\begin{abstract}
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) offer high efficiency and fuel flexibility, yet broad commercial adoption is constrained by performance degradation and limited service life under realistic duty cycles. This paper presents a comprehensive, data-driven framework that integrates multi-physics modeling, manufacturing process parameters, and in-situ operational data to co-optimize both fabrication and operation, thereby maximizing lifetime while sustaining electrochemical performance. We merge multivariate datasets spanning thermophysical and mechanical properties, sintering profiles, cooling rates, microstructural attributes, thermal expansion mismatch, and load/thermal cycling histories. Sensitivity and correlation analyses reveal that thermal stress arising from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE/TEC) mismatch dominates mechanical failure modes—especially crack initiation in the electrolyte and interfacial delamination. We further quantify the non-linear acceleration of creep strain and damage accumulation in the Ni–YSZ anode under elevated operating temperatures and repeated cycling. The resulting multi-objective optimization identifies an \emph{actionable} manufacturing window—sintering at \SI{1300}{}–\SI{1350}{\celsius} with controlled cooling at \SIrange{4}{6}{\celsius\per\minute}—that mitigates residual stresses while achieving robust bonding. Concurrently, an operating temperature window of \SI{750}{}–\SI{800}{\celsius} balances electrochemical activity against degradation kinetics. The proposed methodology establishes a generalizable template for leveraging heterogeneous data and surrogate models to guide the design and management of next-generation, durable SOFC systems.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) convert chemical energy to electricity at high efficiency, with low emissions and fuel flexibility, making them attractive for distributed power and combined heat and power applications \cite{R1,R2}. Despite substantive advances, practical deployment is often limited by degradation phenomena that reduce voltage and accelerate failure under realistic operating conditions \cite{R3,R4}. These degradations arise from the interplay of thermal, mechanical, electrochemical, and chemical processes across heterogeneous, bonded ceramic–metallic layers under substantial thermal gradients and transient cycling \cite{R5}. A durable SOFC must therefore be engineered holistically: from material selection and manufacturing to operational strategies and control.

\subsection{State of the Art}
Traditional SOFC design optimization has emphasized either experimental trial-and-error or single-physics simulation campaigns that isolate specific parameters \cite{R6,R7}. Seminal studies have elucidated critical mechanisms such as: (i) anode re-oxidation and Ni coarsening \cite{R8}, (ii) cathode delamination and chromium poisoning \cite{R9}, (iii) electrolyte fracture \cite{R10}, and (iv) interconnect corrosion \cite{R11}. Meanwhile, targeted investigations have documented specific sensitivities: sintering temperature versus microstructure and bonding strength \cite{R12}, thermal expansion mismatch versus residual and operational stresses \cite{R13}, and operating temperature versus creep rate and damage accumulation \cite{R14}. Notwithstanding these contributions, a system-level integration that simultaneously couples manufacturing \emph{and} operation to optimize both initial robustness and long-term performance remains underexplored.

\subsection{Research Gap and Objective}
There is a pressing need for a \emph{holistic, data-driven} framework that unifies multi-fidelity sources—material properties, manufacturing conditions, microstructural descriptors, validated finite-element analysis (FEA), and in-situ operational data—into a coherent optimization pipeline. The primary objective of this work is to develop such a methodology and to demonstrate co-optimization of manufacturing and operational parameters that maximize lifetime without sacrificing electrochemical performance.

\subsection{Novelty and Contributions}
The novelty of this work is threefold:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item We consolidate foundational thermophysical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties with manufacturing outputs (porosity, residual stress, TEC mismatch) and operational time series (temperature, load, voltage, strain) into an integrated dataset amenable to statistical learning.
  \item We construct validated multi-physics FE models and train surrogate models (e.g., random forests, Gaussian process regression) to enable global sensitivity analysis (e.g., Sobol indices) and rapid exploration of a high-dimensional parameter space.
  \item We perform multi-objective optimization to reveal \emph{robust} parameter windows that balance initial performance and degradation rate, producing \emph{actionable} recommendations: sintering at \SI{1300}{}–\SI{1350}{\celsius} (cooling \SIrange{4}{6}{\celsius\per\minute}) and operating at \SI{750}{}–\SI{800}{\celsius}.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:methods} details the multi-physics models, datasets, and optimization workflow. Section~\ref{sec:results} reports correlation findings, manufacturing and operational sensitivities, and Pareto fronts. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with implications, limitations, and future work.

\section{Methodology: Multi-Physics Modeling and Data Integration} \label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Component-Level Constitutive Models}
We consider a representative cell stack cross-section comprising a porous Ni–YSZ anode, dense 8YSZ electrolyte, LSM cathode, and a Crofer 22 APU metallic interconnect. Each component is assigned temperature-dependent thermophysical and mechanical properties consistent with operating regimes of \SI{600}{}–\SI{1000}{\celsius} (Table~\ref{tab:materials}). Elasticity, creep, and where relevant plasticity are included:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Elasticity:} Temperature-dependent Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for each phase. The electrolyte is modeled as dense and stiff (\(E\approx\SI{170}{GPa}\) at \SI{800}{\celsius}), while the porous anode is more compliant (\(E\approx\SIrange{29}{55}{GPa}\), porosity-dependent).
  \item \textbf{Creep:} Norton-type creep for the Ni–YSZ anode, \(\dot{\varepsilon}_{\mathrm{cr}} = B\,\sigma^{n} \exp(-Q/RT)\), with $(B,n,Q)$ fit at multiple temperatures; exemplar values include $B=\SI{50}{s^{-1}MPa^{-n}}$, $n=1.4$, $Q=\SI{255}{kJ\,mol^{-1}}$ at \SI{800}{\celsius}. Electrolyte creep is orders of magnitude smaller.
  \item \textbf{Plasticity:} A Johnson–Cook-type yield law is used for the Ni-bearing anode matrix where indicated by high stresses, with reference yield around \SI{100}{MPa} and strain hardening to capture permanent set during transients.
\end{itemize}
Electrochemical transport is represented at a lumped level via ionic/electronic conductivities and exchange current densities to compute ohmic and activation contributions to cell voltage; these parameters provide coupling between thermal loading (Joule heating) and performance.

\subsection{Thermophysical and Electrochemical Properties}
Table~\ref{tab:materials} summarizes representative values at \SI{800}{\celsius}. Thermal conductivity, specific heat, density, and TEC inform thermal stress evolution; ionic and electronic conductivities and exchange current densities inform electrochemical performance. While full temperature functions can be accommodated, we anchor analysis near the \SI{750}{}–\SI{800}{\celsius} operating window identified by optimization.

\end{table*}

\subsection{Finite Element Configuration and Validation}
A 2D plane-strain or 3D segment FEA model is constructed with explicit layer geometries and interfaces, conforming meshes near expected hotspots (corners, edges, triple-phase boundaries), and temperature-dependent boundary conditions to emulate start-up/shut-down and load cycling. Mechanical boundary conditions include fixed constraints at selected reference points and a nominal \SI{0.2}{MPa} top pressure. Thermal boundary conditions prescribe nominal setpoints (\SI{750}{}–\SI{800}{\celsius}) with gradients to mimic edge hotspots. Electrical boundary conditions set the anode to \SI{0}{V} and cathode to \SI{0.7}{V} to match the operating point.

Model validation proceeds against (i) strain-versus-temperature hysteresis measured across 5 thermal cycles, (ii) residual stress estimates from post-sintering measurements (e.g., XRD/curvature), and (iii) voltage decay trajectories under coupled thermo-mechanical-electrochemical loading. The calibrated model reproduces increasing strain ratcheting and damage parameter $D$ across cycles, and attributes observed delamination to growing interface shear.

\subsection{Design of Experiments and Data Generation}
We define a parameter hypercube spanning manufacturing inputs and operational conditions (Table~\ref{tab:doe}). A Latin hypercube sampling produces $\geq$\,\num{10000} virtual experiments. For each, the FEA yields stress, strain, and damage metrics; a reduced electrochemical model computes initial voltage and degradation rate.

    Cycling Count (cycles) & 1--5 & As low as feasible \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{-0.5em}
\end{table}

\subsection{Outputs, Labels, and Health Metrics}
Primary outputs include peak von Mises stress in the electrolyte, interface shear stress, residual stress post-sintering, anode creep strain rate and total strain, damage parameter $D$, crack risk index, delamination probability, initial voltage, and voltage degradation rate. We record descriptive statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, quantiles) for all variables and verify physical plausibility (e.g., monotonic voltage loss with increasing damage).

\subsection{Surrogate Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis}
Surrogate models (random forest regressors, gradient-boosted trees, and Gaussian processes) are trained on FEA-derived labels to enable rapid inference across the parameter space. Cross-validation ensures generalization. Global sensitivity (Sobol indices) and permutation importance reveal dominant drivers: TEC mismatch, operating temperature, and cooling rate emerge as leading contributors to stress hotspots, delamination probability, and damage rate.

\subsection{Multi-Objective Optimization}
We solve a two-objective optimization: (i) maximize initial performance (voltage/current density) and (ii) minimize degradation/lifetime risk (e.g., damage growth rate, crack/delamination probabilities). A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) explores the surrogate landscape with constraints to enforce manufacturability (e.g., porosity bounds) and safety (e.g., maximum stress threshold). The Pareto front characterizes the trade-off between high initial performance at higher temperature and improved longevity at moderated temperature and better TEC matching.

\subsection{Uncertainty Quantification and Robustness}
We propagate uncertainty in material properties, TEC mismatch, and process variability via Monte Carlo resampling through the surrogates. The resulting probabilistic Pareto sets identify robust operating points whose performance persists under plausible perturbations.

\section{Results and Discussion} \label{sec:results}
\subsection{Correlation Analysis of Degradation Drivers}
Figure~\ref{fig:correlation} sketches representative correlations extracted from the synthetic dataset. TEC mismatch shows strong positive correlation with both stress hotspots and delamination probability; operating temperature exhibits a super-linear relationship with anode creep rate and damage parameter $D$. Sintering temperature and cooling rate co-determine residual stress: undersintering leads to poor bonding and higher local stress, while oversintering and overly rapid cooling induce large thermal gradients and locked-in stress.

\subsection{Manufacturing Effects on Residual Stress and Initial State}
Figure~\ref{fig:residual} shows the dependence of residual stress on sintering temperature and cooling rate. The recommended window (\SI{1300}{}–\SI{1350}{\celsius}, \SI{4}{}–\SI{6}{\celsius\per\minute}) emerges from a balance: sufficient diffusion and bonding at peak temperature, coupled with moderated cooling that avoids steep thermal gradients and allows partial stress relaxation. The manufacturing dataset confirms the downstream influence: porosity in the anode rising from \(\sim\)\SI{12}{\percent} to \(\sim\)\SI{36.7}{\percent} reduces hardness from \SI{5.5}{GPa} to $<\SI{1}{GPa}$, dramatically increasing compliance and local stress concentrations under load.

\subsection{Operational Degradation: Temperature, Cycling, and Performance Loss}
Thermal cycling and high operating temperature accelerate creep in the Ni–YSZ anode. Figure~\ref{fig:creep} quantifies damage growth $D$ over five cycles at different temperatures. At \SI{800}{\celsius}, damage accumulates faster than at \SI{750}{\celsius}, correlating with larger ratcheting strain and increased crack risk. Figure~\ref{fig:voltage} links damage to voltage decay (e.g., \SI{1.02}{V} $\to$ \SI{0.70}{V} over five cycles), consistent with rising ohmic and polarization losses in EIS-derived parameters.

\subsection{Data-Driven Optimization and Pareto Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:pareto} displays a representative Pareto front between initial performance and degradation rate. Designs at higher operating temperature deliver superior initial voltage but degrade faster; designs with moderated temperature and improved TEC matching yield lower initial voltage but markedly slower degradation. The recommended window (Table~\ref{tab:doe}) sits on a robust portion of the Pareto set with limited sensitivity to manufacturing variability.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Ablation and Sensitivity}
Removing TEC mismatch from the surrogate inputs significantly reduces predictive power for delamination probability (\(\Delta R^2 \approx 0.25\)), confirming its primacy. Similarly, excluding cooling rate increases prediction error for residual stress features, underscoring the processing–structure–property linkage. Sobol indices rank TEC mismatch and operating temperature as the top two contributors to damage growth, followed by sintering temperature and cooling rate.

\subsection{Practical Guidelines}
The combined evidence motivates the following guidelines: (i) prioritize TEC matching through material choice and composition control; (ii) target sintering around \SI{1300}{}–\SI{1350}{\celsius} with cooling at \SIrange{4}{6}{\celsius\per\minute}; (iii) operate at \SI{750}{}–\SI{800}{\celsius} with thermal management to minimize gradients and cycling severity; and (iv) monitor damage proxies (strain, impedance growth) to adapt operating envelopes proactively.

\section{Conclusion and Outlook} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presented a data-driven framework that unifies manufacturing and operational decision-making for SOFCs. By integrating multi-physics FEA with heterogeneous datasets and surrogate modeling, we identified the dominant drivers of degradation—TEC mismatch and operating temperature—and delineated robust manufacturing and operating windows that jointly maximize lifetime and preserve performance. The approach is generalizable to other solid-state electrochemical devices where multi-physics couplings and process variability govern durability.

\textbf{Limitations and Future Work:} Interface idealization, simplified electrochemical coupling, and limited cycle count bound the present scope. Future work will incorporate long-term chemical degradation mechanisms (Ni coarsening, Cr poisoning) into the multi-physics stack model, expand validation with extended stack testing, and integrate active control strategies informed by online health monitoring.
