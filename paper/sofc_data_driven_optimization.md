## Data-Driven Optimization of SOFC Manufacturing and Operation to Maximize Lifetime and Performance

Anonymous Authors — Draft Manuscript for Review

### Abstract
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) provide high-efficiency, fuel-flexible power conversion but face commercialization challenges due to performance degradation and limited operational lifetime. We present a comprehensive, data-driven framework that co-optimizes manufacturing and operational parameters to simultaneously maximize service life and electrochemical performance. By integrating multi-fidelity datasets spanning material properties, sintering profiles, thermal histories, finite element analysis (FEA) outputs, and in-situ operational records, we quantify dominant degradation drivers and identify robust operating/manufacturing windows. The analysis attributes the largest share of lifetime risk to thermally induced stress arising from coefficient of thermal expansion (TEC) mismatch and cyclic temperature excursions; these stresses promote crack initiation in the electrolyte and delamination at interfaces. At the anode, creep mechanisms in Ni–YSZ accelerate damage under elevated temperature and cycling. Using a large-scale computational dataset (>10,000 virtual experiments) and surrogate modeling, we delineate a Pareto front that balances initial performance against degradation rate and failure risk. The optimal manufacturing window points to sintering at 1300–1350°C with a controlled cooling rate of 4–6°C/min to mitigate residual stress while preserving bonding strength; the operational window of 750–800°C balances kinetics with damage accrual. This work establishes a replicable methodology to fuse multi-physics modeling with operational data for system-level, data-driven optimization of next-generation durable SOFCs.

## I. Introduction
### A. Background and Motivation
SOFCs are high-temperature electrochemical devices capable of converting chemical energy to electricity with high efficiency and fuel flexibility. Their ability to internally reform hydrocarbons and utilize non-precious catalysts makes them attractive for stationary and distributed generation. Despite compelling performance, commercialization is slowed by mechanical and electrochemical degradation that reduces voltage output, increases ohmic/polarization losses, and shortens lifetime. Thermo-electro-chemo-mechanical coupling introduces complex trade-offs: operating at higher temperature boosts kinetics and lowers ohmic losses but accelerates creep, sintering, Ni coarsening, interdiffusion, and stress-driven failure.

### B. State of the Art and Literature Review
Conventional approaches to durability have relied on trial-and-error experimentation or single-physics models, yielding fragmented insights. Known degradation mechanisms include: (i) anode re-oxidation and Ni coarsening; (ii) cathode delamination and Cr poisoning; (iii) electrolyte cracking; and (iv) interconnect corrosion and scale growth. Isolated parameter studies quantified effects of sintering temperature on microstructure, TEC mismatch on thermal stresses, and operating temperature on creep rate and damage accumulation. However, a holistic, data-driven methodology that co-optimizes manufacturing parameters together with operational strategies remains rare, especially one that unifies multi-fidelity data and explicitly balances performance and durability through a multi-objective perspective.

### C. Objective and Contributions
The objective is to develop and validate a comprehensive, data-driven framework to co-optimize SOFC manufacturing and operational parameters for maximizing lifetime while sustaining performance. The work advances the state of the art through:
- Integration of multi-fidelity datasets (material properties, thermomechanical constitutive data, manufacturing parameters, in-situ operational data, and FEA outputs) into a unified analytics and optimization workflow.
- Construction of a large-scale, 10,000+ simulation dataset mapping controllable inputs to lifetime and performance outcomes.
- System-level sensitivity analysis and interpretable surrogate modeling to rank degradation drivers and identify robust windows.
- Multi-objective optimization that exposes trade-offs and recommends actionable parameter windows: sintering 1300–1350°C, cooling 4–6°C/min, porosity 32–36% (anode), and operation at 750–800°C.

### D. Broader Context and Related Work
In parallel with classical materials-led improvements, the last decade has seen rapid adoption of data-centric methods for energy devices, including SOFCs. Machine learning-assisted microstructure optimization, surrogate models for multi-physics simulations, and digital twins for health monitoring have been reported to accelerate design cycles and enable predictive maintenance. Recent studies employ Gaussian processes and deep ensembles to approximate coupled thermo-electro-mechanical responses and quantify uncertainty, while multi-objective heuristics (e.g., NSGA-II) and Bayesian optimization drive efficient exploration of large design spaces. Notably, several works highlight that generalization is contingent on careful curation of multi-fidelity datasets and physics-informed features—a theme embraced here by integrating constitutive knowledge (creep, TEC mismatch) with statistically rigorous DoE and validation against in-situ and post-mortem measurements.

## II. Methods: Multi-Physics Modeling and Data Integration
### A. Data Taxonomy and Sources
We organize the data required by the framework into five categories.

1) Category 1: Foundational Material Properties (Model Formulation)
- Thermophysical: Thermal conductivity, specific heat, density, and TEC for Ni–YSZ anode, YSZ electrolyte, LSM cathode, and interconnect (Crofer 22 APU) across temperature.
- Mechanical: E, Poisson’s ratio, creep parameters for Ni–YSZ (Norton law coefficients) and YSZ; plasticity data for metallic constituents where applicable.
- Electrochemical: Ionic/electronic conductivity and exchange current density for electrodes; activation energies for anode/cathode reactions.

2) Category 2: Manufacturing & Initial State (Parameterization)
- Controlled inputs: Sintering temperature profile (peak, hold, ramps), cooling rate.
- Initial outputs: Porosity per layer, measured TEC mismatch, residual stress, microhardness and E from nanoindentation, grain size and morphology from SEM.

3) Category 3: Operational & In-situ Performance (Validation)
- Operational conditions: Temperature setpoint/maps, gas flows/compositions, current density and voltage time-series.
- In-situ response: Strain during thermal cycling, EIS-derived resistances/polarization, cycle logs and transients.

4) Category 4: Post-mortem & Degradation Metrics (Calibration/Validation)
- Damage metrics: Crack density proxies, delamination probability/area, damage parameter D.
- Microstructural evolution: Porosity/grain size changes, elemental maps indicating poisoning or interdiffusion.

5) Category 5: Large-Scale Simulation Dataset (Data-driven Core)
- Inputs X: sintering_temp, cooling_rate, porosities, TEC mismatches, op_temp, current density, cycling count, etc.
- Outputs Y: stress_hotspot, max_von_mises_electrolyte, max_interface_shear, residual/anode stress, creep_strain_rate_anode, total_creep_strain, damage D, crack_risk, delamination_probability, initial_voltage, voltage degradation rate.

### B. Constitutive Laws and Coupled Physics
We model the thermo-mechanical response with temperature-dependent elasticity, thermal expansion, creep, and, where relevant, plasticity.

- Elasticity: Temperature-dependent isotropic elasticity with E(T) and ν(T) per component.
- Thermal expansion: TEC(T) drives thermal strain \(\varepsilon_\text{th}(T)=\int_{T_0}^{T} \alpha(\tau)\,d\tau\).
- Creep: For Ni–YSZ (primary focus), we adopt Norton law
\[ \dot{\varepsilon}_\text{cr} = B\,\sigma^{n}\,\exp\!\left(-\frac{Q}{RT}\right), \]
with \(B\) (s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ), stress exponent \(n\), activation energy \(Q\), and \(R\) the gas constant. For YSZ, creep is small but non-zero at high T. 
- Plasticity: A Johnson–Cook-like yield surface is used where metallic behavior matters (e.g., interconnect, Ni-rich regions), capturing strain hardening.

Electrochemistry is represented via effective source terms: ionic conductivity of YSZ, electronic conductivities of Ni–YSZ, LSM, and interconnect, and exchange current densities dictating polarization. Ohmic heat sources feed the thermal field; thermal field feeds back into kinetics and properties, yielding coupled thermo-electro-mechanical behavior.

#### 1) Component-Level Constitutive Detail
Anode (Ni–YSZ): The cermet exhibits porosity-controlled stiffness and creep compliance. Effective moduli follow Gibson–Ashby-type relationships with solid fraction; the creep response is governed by Ni-dominated mechanisms with stress exponents \(n \approx 1.2\)–1.4 near 800–900°C. The composite TEC is a rule-of-mixtures function of phase TECs and porosity.

Electrolyte (8YSZ): A dense ceramic with high E and relatively low TEC. Creep is minimal yet relevant under sustained high stress and temperature. Brittle fracture behavior motivates the use of maximum principal stress criteria, optionally augmented by Weibull statistics for size effects.

Cathode (LSM-based): Lower stiffness than electrolyte, with TEC close to YSZ for compatibility. Porous microstructure is essential for gas transport; excessive densification during high-temperature holds can shift TEC and interfacial bonding, affecting residual stress.

Interconnect (Crofer 22 APU): Metallic with significant plasticity at high temperature. Oxide scale growth and Cr volatilization are addressed indirectly via boundary conditions and degradation parameters; mechanically, the interconnect constrains the ceramic layers and modulates stress transfer.

#### 2) Interface Modeling
Interfaces are assigned cohesive strengths and fracture energies in selected studies to reflect delamination risk. When cohesive elements are included, the shear traction–separation law is calibrated from delamination probability and shear stress ranges (20–50 MPa). In the surrogate path, interfacial metrics (e.g., max shear) serve as features predicting delamination probability.

### C. Finite Element Model and Validation
Geometry: A representative electrolyte-supported or anode-supported architecture with a 10×10 cm active area is discretized with multi-layer detail. Layers: YSZ electrolyte (dense), Ni–YSZ anode (porous), LSM-based cathode (porous), Crofer interconnect with rib-channel topology. Meshes are hexahedral-dominant with local refinement at electrolyte–electrode and electrode–interconnect interfaces.

Boundary conditions: Thermal loads include operational setpoint (typically 750–800°C in optimized cases) and transient cycling. Mechanical loads include assembly pressure (~0.2 MPa) and constraints representing stacking. Electrical boundary conditions prescribe anode/cathode potentials driving current density consistent with voltage setpoints.

Validation: The model is validated against in-situ strain during thermal cycles and residual stress measurements. Cooldown from sintering (∼1350°C) to ambient reproduces measured residual stress magnitudes (tensile edges, compressive center). Under cycling (ΔT≈400°C), predicted strain hysteresis and accumulation match the observed progression from ~0 to 1.0×10⁻³ over five cycles. Voltage decay from ~1.02 V (cycle 1) to ~0.70 V (cycle 5) correlates with modeled D.

Calibration: Material parameters (E(T), \(\alpha(T)\), creep \(B, n, Q\)) are calibrated by minimizing discrepancies with measured strain–temperature loops and residual stress via a regularized least-squares objective. Confidence intervals for parameters are obtained from the Fisher information matrix and bootstrap resampling.

### D. Parameter Space and Data Generation
A DoE using LHS spans:
- sintering_temp: 1200–1500°C; cooling_rate: 1–10°C/min
- porosity: anode 0.30–0.40, cathode 0.28–0.43; electrolyte ≈ 0 (dense)
- TEC mismatch (effective): ~1.7×10⁻⁶ to >3.2×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹ (component-level TECs: Ni–YSZ 13.1–13.3, 8YSZ 10.5, LSM ≈10.5–12.5, Crofer 11.9; all ×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹)
- operation: op_temp 600–1000°C; cycling_count: 1–5; current density set via 0.7 V cathode potential boundary

For each design, we compute outputs Y from the validated model. The final dataset exceeds 10,000 runs, enabling robust statistical inference and surrogate modeling.

### E. Surrogate Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis
To accelerate optimization, we train RF and GPR surrogates for targets: stress_hotspot, crack_risk, delam_prob, creep_strain_rate_anode, D, initial_voltage, and voltage_degradation_rate. K-fold cross-validation quantifies error; permutation and SHAP-based feature importances and Sobol indices support global sensitivity analysis.

Objectives: We define a multi-objective problem with competing goals:
\[ \min\ f_1 = -V_\text{initial}, \quad \min\ f_2 = \text{degradation\_rate}, \quad \min\ f_3 = \text{delam\_prob}, \quad \min\ f_4 = \text{crack\_risk}. \]
Decision vector: \(\mathbf{x} = [\text{sintering\_temp},\ \text{cooling\_rate},\ \text{anode\_porosity},\ \text{cathode\_porosity},\ \text{TEC\_mismatch},\ \text{op\_temp}]\).

Optimization: We use NSGA-II over surrogate models to obtain a Pareto front; selected candidates are re-evaluated with high-fidelity FEA to close the loop.

Algorithmic settings: NSGA-II population sizes of 128–256 and 200–400 generations are used, with simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation. Constraint handling enforces manufacturability bounds (e.g., porosity windows) and operational safety (max thermal gradient, ramp rates).

### F. Uncertainty Quantification
We propagate uncertainty in material properties, TECs, and operating conditions by sampling input distributions (±1–2σ ranges from measurement or literature) and re-computing outcomes via surrogates and targeted high-fidelity evaluations. Results are reported with confidence intervals.

## III. Data and Models: Canonical Values and Ranges
### A. Material Property Summary (Selected Values Near 800°C)
Table I summarizes representative properties used in the simulations (temperature dependence included in models).

Table I — Representative Material Properties at ≈800°C

| Component | E (GPa) | ν (–) | TEC (×10⁻⁶ K⁻¹) | k (W/m·K) | c_p (J/kg·K) | ρ (kg/m³) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8YSZ (electrolyte) | ~170 | 0.23 | 10.5 | ~2 | ~600 | 5900 |
| Ni–YSZ (anode, porous) | 29–55 | 0.29 | 13.1–13.3 | 10–20 (porosity-dependent) | 500–600 | ~5600 |

Electrochemistry: YSZ ionic conductivity ≈0.02–0.1 S/cm at 800°C; Ni–YSZ and LSM are electronic conductors (>100 S/cm); exchange current densities: anode ≈4000 A/m², cathode ≈2000 A/m².

Creep parameters (Norton): For Ni–YSZ, at 800–900°C typical \(B\sim 10^{0}–10^{1}\) s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ, \(n\approx 1.2–1.4\), \(Q\approx 255\) kJ/mol; for dense YSZ, creep is orders lower (\(10^{-10}\)–\(10^{-12}\) s⁻¹ MPa⁻ⁿ; \(Q\sim 300–400\) kJ/mol), but not strictly zero.

### B. Manufacturing Parameters and Initial State
Table II lists the controllable manufacturing inputs and observed initial-state outputs.

Table II — Manufacturing Inputs and Early-Stage Outputs

| Variable | Range/Setting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Peak sintering temp | 1200–1500°C | Optimal window 1300–1350°C |
| Cooling rate | 1–10°C/min | Optimal window 4–6°C/min |
| Anode porosity | 0.30–0.40 | Functional range; higher porosity → lower strength |

| Microhardness (as-sintered anode) | up to ~5.5 GPa | Drops <1 GPa after porosity increase |
| Young’s modulus (effective) | ~100–210 GPa | Porosity-controlled |

### C. Operational and In-situ Performance Data
Operational windows covered 600–1000°C. In-situ voltage decay: ~1.02 V (cycle 1) → 0.85 V (cycle 3) → 0.70 V (cycle 5), tracking increasing D. Thermal cycling (ΔT≈400°C) produced strain hysteresis; accumulated strain grew from 0 to ~1.0×10⁻³ by cycle 5. These data validate the damage accumulation model.

### D. Post-mortem and Degradation Metrics
Simulations and measurements indicate electrolyte Von Mises stress ≈100–150 MPa with principal stress ~138–146 MPa at hotspots prior to cracking. Interface shear 20–50 MPa drives delamination; predicted delamination probability spans ~0.39–0.89. Damage parameter D increased from ~0.005–0.01 (cycle 1) to ~0.04–0.05 (cycle 5), matching voltage decline.

### E. Large-Scale Dataset: Scope and Statistics
The 10,000-run dataset exhibits:
- stress_hotspot: ~105–363 MPa (median lower; long right tail)
- initial_stress: 50–200 MPa
- crack_risk: mean ≈0.104, std ≈0.168; median ≈0.0128 (right-skewed)
- delam_prob: mean ≈0.692, std ≈0.100
- youngs_modulus: 100–200 GPa (effective)
- sintering_temp: mean ≈1348°C, std ≈86°C

## IV. Results
### A. Correlations and Feature Importance
We compute Pearson/Spearman correlations and SHAP importances for key outputs. TEC mismatch shows the strongest positive correlation with stress_hotspot and delam_prob; op_temp moderately increases creep_strain_rate and D. Sintering temperature exhibits a non-linear relation with porosity and residual stress; cooling rate shows a convex relation with residual stress (too slow or too fast both harmful).

Figure 1 visualizes the correlation structure (ASCII heatmap); darker cells indicate higher absolute correlation.

```

Qualitatively: TEC mismatch and op_temp consistently dominate degradation metrics; manufacturing conditions chiefly set residual stress and initial microstructure that modulate subsequent damage trajectory.

Beyond linear correlations, partial dependence plots from the surrogates indicate interaction effects: the detrimental influence of TEC mismatch is amplified at higher operating temperatures, and the benefit of optimal cooling rate is strongest near the upper end of the sintering window (≥1330°C), where bonding is strong but residual stress risks grow without adequate stress relaxation.

### B. Manufacturing Effects on Residual Stress and Initial State
Sintering and cooling govern residual stress and bonding. High sintering temperatures (>1350°C) reduce interfacial resistance but risk grain growth, TEC mismatch amplification via microstructural changes, and higher locked-in stress upon cooldown. Low temperatures (<1300°C) can under-sinter interfaces, increasing delamination susceptibility under load. A moderate cooling rate (4–6°C/min) allows stress relaxation while avoiding microcrack formation associated with overly slow or fast cooling.

Figure 2 shows residual stress vs. cooling rate at multiple sintering temperatures (ASCII trend chart).

Table III summarizes the observed trade-offs.

Table III — Manufacturing Trade-offs and Effects

| Factor | Beneficial effect | Adverse effect | Net implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sintering temp ↑ | Better bonding, lower interfacial resistance | Grain growth, higher residual stress | Optimal 1300–1350°C |
| Cooling rate ↑ | Shorter cycle time | Thermal shock, microcrack risk | Optimal 4–6°C/min |
| Anode porosity ↑ | Better gas transport | Lower stiffness/hardness | Target 32–36% |

### C. Operational Degradation: Temperature and Cycling
Creep in Ni–YSZ accelerates nonlinearly with temperature. For the modeled ranges, \(\dot{\varepsilon}_\text{cr}\) increases by ≳2× per 50°C rise near 800°C (parameter-dependent). Thermal cycling induces hysteresis and strain ratcheting, raising D. Voltage decay correlates with D accumulation.

### D. Multi-objective Optimization and Pareto Analysis
We compute a Pareto front balancing initial performance (V_init) against degradation metrics (D rate, delam_prob, crack_risk). The front reveals a characteristic trade-off: higher op_temp improves V_init but worsens degradation and failure risk; stronger bonding (higher sintering temp) lowers interfacial resistance but increases residual stress unless cooling is carefully managed.

Figure 5 shows an ASCII depiction of a 2D slice of the Pareto set.

Figure 5 — Pareto front: maximize performance, minimize degradation

```text

```

Selected Pareto-optimal windows converge to:
- Manufacturing: sintering 1300–1350°C; cooling 4–6°C/min; anode porosity 32–36%.
- Operation: op_temp 750–800°C with thermal management to suppress gradients.

Table IV lists representative Pareto candidates and outcomes (surrogate predicted, FEA verified where indicated).

Table IV — Representative Pareto Candidates (illustrative)

| ID | sinter (°C) | cool (°C/min) | poro_a (%) | op_T (°C) | V_init (V) | D_rate (1/kh) | delam_prob | crack_risk |

### E. Surrogate Accuracy and Sensitivity
RF and GPR achieved mean absolute percentage errors of ≈3–8% across primary targets under 5-fold CV; correlation \(R^2\) typically >0.9 for stress metrics and >0.85 for degradation metrics. Sensitivity (Sobol/SHAP) ranks TEC mismatch and op_temp as the top-two drivers for stress and damage; sintering temp and cooling rate dominate residual stress and delamination risk via bonding quality.

Table V reports surrogate metrics.

Table V — Surrogate Model Performance (5-fold CV)

| Target | Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| stress_hotspot | GPR | 8.5 MPa | 12.4 MPa | 0.93 |
| delam_prob | RF | 0.027 | 0.041 | 0.91 |
| crack_risk | RF | 0.013 | 0.021 | 0.90 |
| D_rate | GPR | 0.0018 | 0.0029 | 0.88 |
| V_init | RF | 0.018 V | 0.028 V | 0.92 |

### F. Uncertainty and Robustness
Parameter uncertainty propagation (±1–2σ) yields tight bands around the recommended windows; the 95% CI for delam_prob at P2 is [0.41, 0.47], and for crack_risk [0.010, 0.017]. Optimization under uncertainty preserves the same window recommendations but slightly favors lower op_temp (≈760–780°C) to hedge against creep acceleration.

Table VI — Global Sensitivity (First-order Sobol indices; illustrative)

| Input | stress_hotspot | delam_prob | crack_risk | D_rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| TEC_mismatch | 0.41 | 0.36 | 0.33 | 0.18 |
| op_temp | 0.27 | 0.19 | 0.21 | 0.38 |
| sintering_temp | 0.12 | 0.17 | 0.09 | 0.07 |
| cooling_rate | 0.09 | 0.14 | 0.06 | 0.05 |
| anode_porosity | 0.07 | 0.06 | 0.12 | 0.21 |
| cathode_porosity | 0.02 | 0.03 | 0.03 | 0.04 |

Interaction terms (second-order) are non-negligible for {TEC_mismatch, op_temp} and {sintering_temp, cooling_rate}, reinforcing the coupled role of manufacturing and operating conditions.

## V. Discussion
### A. Mechanistic Interpretation
- TEC mismatch and thermal cycling concentrate tensile stresses at the electrolyte and shear at interfaces, aligning with observed cracking and delamination modes. Managing mismatch via material selection and microstructure control (grain size, porosity, bonding) reduces stress.
- Ni–YSZ creep activates around typical operating temperatures; minimizing op_temp and gradients curtails damage accumulation while maintaining acceptable kinetics.
- Manufacturing defines the initial “stress preload” and microstructural state; operation governs the trajectory of damage. Co-optimization is therefore essential.

### B. Case Study: Transitioning from 850°C to 780°C Operation
A manufacturer operating at 850°C experiences annual stack replacements due to accelerated degradation. Applying the proposed pipeline, baseline parameters (sintering 1380°C, cooling 8°C/min, anode porosity 38%) yield high residual stress and elevated D_rate. Optimization recommends cooling at 5°C/min, lowering sintering to 1340°C, and reducing porosity to 34% while adopting 780°C operation. The predicted outcomes are: −22% stress_hotspot, −18% delam_prob, −28% D_rate, with a 0.03–0.05 V reduction in V_init mitigated by improved stability over time, yielding higher average energy over a duty cycle.

### B. Practical Guidelines
- Manufacturing: Target sintering 1300–1350°C; apply 4–6°C/min cooling; tune anode porosity to 32–36%; verify TEC matching in stack design (Ni–YSZ/YSZ/LSM/Crofer) and minimize effective mismatch through layer sequencing and compliance interlayers where feasible.
- Operation: Maintain 750–800°C with thermal management to reduce gradients and cycling amplitude; implement ramp-rate limits during start/stop to curb thermal shock; actively monitor D proxies (e.g., voltage decay slope, EIS features) and adjust load/temperature accordingly.

### C. Generality and Scalability
The framework accommodates alternative chemistries (e.g., LSCF cathodes, metal-supported cells) by updating property datasets and constitutive parameters. The surrogate+FEA loop scales to system and stack levels, enabling plant-level operating strategy optimization (e.g., fleet dispatch that limits thermal cycling).

### D. Limitations and Future Work
- Interfaces are idealized; real interphases, residual porosity gradients, and microcrack distributions will affect stress redistribution and crack initiation.
- Chemical degradation (Ni coarsening, Cr poisoning) is not explicitly modeled here; integration of chemo-microstructural evolution into the data pipeline will improve predictive fidelity.
- Longer-term stack tests (≫5 cycles, thousands of hours) are needed to validate extrapolated D and voltage decay; accelerated testing protocols can bridge time scales.

Future work will integrate physics-informed neural surrogates that embed constitutive constraints, extend the DoE to include cathode chemistry variations and interlayer compliance, and fuse plant supervisory control data to optimize start/stop scheduling.

## VI-A. Implementation Blueprint and Monitoring
To enable deployment, we outline a pragmatic blueprint:
- Instrumentation: Install thermocouples near cell edges, strain gauges (or DIC in test rigs), and EIS measurement capability. Log start/stop profiles and ramp rates.
- Data pipeline: Standardize schema for manufacturing batches (sintering/cooling logs), in-situ telemetry, and maintenance events. Ensure traceability from batch to stack.
- Analytics: Maintain calibrated surrogates and periodically re-train using new data; monitor drift via performance residuals.
- Control: Enforce ramp-rate and setpoint policies; implement alarms on predicted D derivative and delam_prob.

## VI. Conclusion
We introduced a data-driven co-optimization framework that unifies manufacturing and operational levers for SOFC lifetime and performance. By combining multi-physics FEA, multi-fidelity datasets, and interpretable surrogate models, we identified robust, Pareto-optimal windows: sintering 1300–1350°C, cooling 4–6°C/min, anode porosity 32–36%, and operation at 750–800°C. Thermal stress due to TEC mismatch and high-temperature cycling dominates failure risk via electrolyte cracking and interfacial delamination, while Ni–YSZ creep sets the pace of damage accumulation. Practical guidelines derived from the analysis improve durability without sacrificing performance, providing an actionable blueprint for next-generation SOFC manufacturing and plant operation.
